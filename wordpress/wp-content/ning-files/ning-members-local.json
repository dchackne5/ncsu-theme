My position is currently funded via a grant from the National eXtension Initiative where I am the Systems Manager in the Information Technology group of eXtension. We are in the process of building a national repository of information aggregated from sources throughout the land-grant system. My role, as one of my former colleagues has remarked, is to do \u201cstuff\u201d. My stuff mostly consists of information architecture, VMWare, Linux and Macintosh system administration, and web software development (mostly Ruby on Rails)."},"profilePhoto":"members/346-n723856221_113661_8971.jpg?crop=1%3A1","level":"member","state":"active","contributorName":"1ou9m4evpyyeo"},{"createdDate":"2008-11-10T21:33:53.000Z","fullName":"Margaret Hudacko","gender":"f","location":"Lillington, NC","country":"US","birthdate":"1960-04-25","email":"hudacko@gmail.com","profileQuestions":{"What department or college do you work for?":"ITECS/College of Engineering","What languages and applications do you focus on?":"PHP\nMySQL\nPerl","Web address or blog?":"<a href=\"http://www.itecs.ncsu.edu/\">http://www.itecs.ncsu.edu/</a>"},"profilePhoto":"members/347-183x183stitch.jpg?crop=1%3A1","level":"member","state":"active","contributorName":"11j9b5inrnbhl"},{"createdDate":"2008-11-10T20:20:57.000Z","fullName":"Luis Chacon","gender":"m","location":"Raleigh, NC","country":"US","birthdate":"1976-01-01","email":"lrchacon@gmail.com","profileQuestions":{"What department or college do you work for?":"Web Communication","What languages and applications do you focus on?":"php\nmysql\nwordpress\ndreamweaver\ncontribute\nCascade Server - XML/XSLT","Web address or blog?":"<a href=\"http://ncsu.edu\">http://ncsu.edu</a>","URL to your twitter page (if you don&#039;t tweet, you should check out http://www.twitter.com)":"<a href=\"http://twitter.com/lrchacon\">http://twitter.com/lrchacon</a>"},"profilePhoto":"members/348-1065928105.jpeg?xgip=0%3A134%3A1197%3A1197%3B%3B&crop=1%3A1","level":"admin","state":"active","contributorName":"0uxf6aiu6dkz6"},{"createdDate":"2008-11-10T19:39:21.000Z","fullName":"Dave Lyons","gender":"m","location":"Cary, NC","country":"US","birthdate":"1966-02-13","email":"dmlyons2@ncsu.edu","profileQuestions":{"What department or college do you work for?":"ComTech Engineering","What languages and applications do you focus on?":"PHP, MySQL","Tell us a little about yourself:":"Hi - Dave here, working on a project to document the physical layer of NCSU's network."},"profilePhoto":"members/349-11Nov0825123PM.jpg?crop=1%3A1","level":"member","state":"active","contributorName":"048o8i00t8d9v"},{"createdDate":"2008-11-10T19:18:19.000Z","fullName":"Nancy R.
