The infowindows correctly detach, but after a few searches, you end up with several A's, B's, and C's. Also, I hit some weird situation (possibly difficult to reproduce, sorry) where I was typing vet and I had a bunch of people with V's in their name, but the map was correctly showing the Vet Med buildings.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Those are mostly just edge cases, but the one thing that I would like to work is that I don't show up on the map.

Thing is, I had written some convenient shell scripts to automate moving files around for a CMS I still support. I can still apply patches through sFTP, but the scripts make it easier to set up copies of the system for testing, check/reset the permissions on certain file types, that sort of thing. So what I wanted was to get access to a shell without having shell access to the server.\n\nThe two tools that presented themselves were Oracle (formerly Sun) Virtual Box running Ubuntu, and sshfs, a Linux filesystem-in-userspace implemented over the SFTP protocol. (VMWare could be used just as well as Virtual Box.) Launching an Ubuntu machine, I can either take a snapshot using sFTP or use sshfs to mount my sFTP point as a remote file system:\nmkdir mntpt\nsshfs myunityname@ftp.ncsu.edu:/afs/eos.ncsu.edu/therestofmypath/ mntpt\n\nThe VM gives me the shell my scripts want, and sshfs lets me move around the live file system of my Web server with the shell, without necessarily having to make a snapshot. Having said that, operating hot on a live site is risky, batch reads/writes over sshfs tend to be very slow operations, and the connection will often time out or break when kept open for long periods. But sometimes being able to run Linux commands against a filesystem, from a shell console, is a convenient way to work.","createdDate":"2010-07-08T21:48:35.000Z","updatedDate":"2014-04-11T21:39:11.272Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2010-07-08T21:48:35.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:12211","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"Good point Mitch.

First, the servers' processes are more isolated from the external shell users. Second, the local client is not limited in the variety of executable programs available since they are running on your own system. The worst downsides are the speed and the connection timeout, both which make it impractical to use it for automation.

Balling</font><br/>today and found a few interesting things, I just thought I'd share...<br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. One Complex Query or Several Simple Ones?</span><br/>\"One important query design question is whether it's preferable to break up a complex query into several simpler queries. The traditional approach to database design emphasizes doing as much work as possible with as few queries as possible. This approach was historically better because of the cost of network communication and the overhead of the query parsing and optimization stages. <br/> <br/>However, this advice doesn't apply as much to MySQL, because it was designed to handle connecting and disconnecting very efficiently and to respond to small and simple queries very quickly. Modern networks are also significantly faster than they used to be, reducing network latency. MySQL can run more than 50,000 simple queries per second on commodity server hardware and over 2,000 queries per second from a single correspondent on a Gigabit network, so running multiple queries isn't necessarily such a bad thing.\"<br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. Establishing a standard for how you write queries will help give you a performance boost</span><br/>\"Before even parsing a query, MySQL checks for it in the query cache, if the cache is enabled. This operation is a case sensitive hash lookup. If the query differs from a similar query in the cache by even a single byte, it won't match, and the query processing will go to the next stage.\"<br/><br/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">This means that \"SELECT firstname, lastname FROM people\" is different from \"SELECT lastname, firstname FROM people\" even though they essentially fetch the same data result.</span><br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. DATETIME columns require twice as much space as TIMESTAMP</span><br/>\"a DATETIME and a TIMESTAMP column can store the same kind of data: date and time, to a precision of one second. However, TIMESTAMP uses only half as much storage space, is time zone\u2013aware, and has special autoupdating capabilities\"<br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. An ENUM column can store up to 65,535 distinct string values</span><br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">5. Indexes can affect row level locking</span><br/>\"Indexes play a very important role for InnoDB, because they let queries lock fewer rows. This is an important consideration, because in MySQL 5.0 InnoDB never unlocks a row until the transaction commits.<br/><br/>If your queries never touch rows they don't need, they'll lock fewer rows, and that's better for performance for two reasons. First, even though InnoDB's row locks are very efficient and use very little memory, there's still some overhead involved in row locking. Secondly, locking more rows than needed increases lock contention and reduces concurrency.\"<br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">6. COUNT(*) is better than COUNT(table.id)</span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"/>\"One of the most common mistakes we see is specifying column names inside the parentheses when you want to count rows. When you want to know the number of rows in the result, you should always use COUNT(*). This communicates your intention clearly and avoids poor performance\"<br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">7. SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</span> <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">is an evil shortcut</span><br/>\"Another common technique for paginated displays is to add the SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS hint to a query with a LIMIT, so you'll know how many rows would have been returned without the LIMIT. It may seem that there's some kind of \"magic\" happening here, whereby the server predicts how many rows it would have found. But unfortunately, the server doesn't really do that; it can't count rows it doesn't actually find. This option just tells the server to generate and throw away the rest of the result set, instead of stopping when it reaches the desired number of rows. That's very expensive.<br/><br/>A better design is to convert the pager to a \"next\" link. Assuming there are 20 results per page, the query should then use a LIMIT of 21 rows and display only 20. If the 21st row exists in the results, there's a next page, and you can render the \"next\" link.<br/><br/>Another possibility is to fetch and cache many more rows than you need\u2014say, 1,000\u2014and then retrieve them from the cache for successive pages. This strategy lets your application know how large the full result set is. If it's fewer than 1,000 rows, the application knows how many page links to render; if it's more, the application can just display \"more than 1,000 results found.\" Both strategies are much more efficient than repeatedly generating an entire result and discarding most of it.<br/><br/>Even when you can't use these tactics, using a separate COUNT(*) query to find the number of rows can be much faster than SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS, if it can use a covering index.\"<br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">8. Using \"MATCH (columns) AGAINST (value)\" allows you to conduct searches in either Boolean or Natural Language Modes</span> <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">and ranks your results, a significant improvement over \"LIKE %value%'\"</span><br/>\"A natural-language search query determines each document's relevance to the query. Relevance is based on the number of matched words and the frequency with which they occur in the document. Words that are less common in the entire index make a match more relevant. In contrast, extremely common words aren't worth searching for at all. A natural-language full-text search excludes words that exist in more than 50% of the rows in the table, even if they're not in the stopword list.<br/><br/>In Boolean searches, the query itself specifies the relative relevance of each word in a match.<br/>When constructing a Boolean search query, you can use prefixes to modify the relative ranking of each keyword in the search string. The most commonly used modifiers are shown below...<br/>dinosaur Rows containing \"dinosaur\" rank higher.<br/>~dinosaur Rows containing \"dinosaur\" rank lower.<br/>+dinosaur Rows must contain \"dinosaur\".<br/>-dinosaur Rows must not contain \"dinosaur\".<br/>dino* Rows containing words that begin with \"dino\" rank higher.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>","createdDate":"2010-04-01T18:35:20.000Z","updatedDate":"2014-11-13T06:38:59.010Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2010-04-01T18:35:19.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:11626","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"The key with #1 is to make sure to avoid O(n) or worse situations. Too often applications will launch hundreds or thousands of queries in an attempt to create an elegant solution. Where elegant solutions are desirable, it is also important to provide short cuts so that performance doesn't suffer. If you use appropriate keys and indexes, joins can save the day. For example: if you want to get a list of enrollments for courses which are taught through distance education and have a tuition waiver, you can set up the INNER JOIN such that the database can determine how best to optimize the order of the tables. If the number of total tuition waivers is lower than the number of total enrollments, then the join can be automatically reversed by the optimization engine to minimize the number of enrollments considered (the reverse is also true). It is vital that any SELECT queries are EXPLAIN'ed to ensure that they are making effective use of available keys. A table with 50 million rows and a where on an unindexed field is much worse than a poorly written join on small tables.","createdDate":"2010-04-05T15:15:04.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:11599","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","description":"#1 re-enforced what we've been doing for a while.

It's your website. You would be using this service to improve your site, not spy on users for the fun of it.\n\n2. If you are concerned, just don't connect the tracking service with an actual user.

Instead of replying just to the person who wrote to me, I thought I'd post to the web dev community. Who knows, maybe someone else will find it useful or maybe it will start a flame war, though most-likely it'll just sit here quietly ;-)\n\nFirst, the idea of a content management system is to distribute the task of writing web pages to multiple people instead of just the few \"web savvy\" folks in your unit. You would adopt one of these systems because they are so easy a caveman could do it. The problem is that although all of these systems do make it possible for the uninitiated to write to the Web, none of them do a good job helping people write good-clean code and snappy content. You may not need to pass all web page updates through your local web guy anymore, but you still need trained (and preferably experienced) staffers in these web writing positions.\n\nAnway, to get to the tools, I can't comment on Joomla (or Cascade either for that matter - another popular CMS on campus). I'll break down the other 3 below:\n\n<b>Adobe Contribute</b>\nThis is the desktop software solution for content management. It's the system we use at CNR and it was in place before my arrival here. I'm sure there are other things like this software out there, but it is honestly the only one I know of. We install the program individually (we have no way of packaging and distributing the install over Active Directory) and connect to sites through \"keys.\" I won't go into detail, but if you do want to see how it works, I made a handy little <a href=\"http://cnr.ncsu.edu/it_services/files/contribute_manual.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">manual</a> for Contribute use in our college. The key features include being able to role back to previous versions for every page in a site, the ability to send drafts back and forth facilitated by email and some decent options as far as what to limit a user's abilities too (take away ability to do in-line styling, using font tags or even force them to choose from a list of styles you define).\n\nMigrating over to it: Converting over from a standard HTML site is instantaneous. You just define a connection and start administering and away you go. However if you want to do it right, you'll first have to convert all pages to follow the Dreamweaver Template method - otherwise you might experience some chaos. Templates allow you to restrict users from touching certain defined areas on your site - like your menu or your banner.\n\nPros/Cons:So there are a lot of pros as far as getting going fast and an easy-to-manage workflow of content drafting/publishing. Some cons are that it isn't a platform for development like the other systems are. You can't grab a plugin for, say, polling and turn it on and have polling on your site. You'd have to make it yourself or find a stand-alone open source solution for whatever extra functionality you're looking for. Another lesser con is the task of managing permissions and minimizing risk. Basically to give someone access in Contribute to a site you have to let that person have write access to the entire directory on the server. Not a huge deal, but something worth mentioning.\n\n<b>Wordpress and Drupal</b>\nIn the world of open source CMSs I've really only used WP and Drupal, but I think they are probably neck and neck as far as the top two options in that category of web apps. And there's a clear difference between the two, WP is happy and blunt. Drupal is cold and fine-grained.\n\nTime:\nManpower:\nCost:\n\n<b>Drupal</b>\nTime:\nManpower:\nCost:","createdDate":"2010-02-04T21:48:15.000Z","updatedDate":"2010-02-04T22:21:00.000Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"draft","publishTime":"2010-02-04T22:21:00.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"2486881:BlogPost:10612","contributorName":"2k7vvpf9lb3q6","title":"Two Good Posts on UI Design","description":"Have you ever seen a form that breaks the telephone number out into three separate fields?

In that time, Linux has grown from being a plaything of hobbyists to becoming an enterprise-ready operating system capable of competing with the likes of AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, and Microsoft Windows. One way that early Linux promoters used to increase interest in Linux was to produce live CDs. A live CD is a CD that boots to an operating system that doesn't rely on any other storage to become a fully operational machine. The very first Linux distribution offered in Live CD form was Yggdrasil Linux, way back in 1992-1993. Think about using 1x CD drives on a 386dx running at 33Mhz trying to bring up a full GUI based desktop and you'll realize why those first forays into live CDs didn't take the world by storm. Fast forward ten years, to the halcyon days of 2003, when Knoppix was unleashed upon the world by Klaus Knopper [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_cd\" target=\"_blank\">cite</a>].\n\nKnoppix was built from the ground up to not merely boot the operating system to a bare shell prompt, oh no. It was designed to poke and prod your hardware to do its darndest to be up, running, and fully available by the time you see a pretty graphical desktop environment. It's entertaining just to burn a CD or DVD image of the thing to watch how much stuff it finds on your machine to make use of. Hard drives are scanned and shown via icons (nothing is modified unless you do so, however), portable storage is shown, networking is started if possible, sound is auto-configured (and you know its working because the startup sound is a female voice saying \"Initiating startup procedure\"), and all of the things that nay-sayers whine about are simply done for you automagically. To steal a line from the Mac fanboys, \"It Just Works\".\n\nOK, you're still not convinced, why bother with Knoppix (or any other live CD)? Why download a 700Mb iso file for CD or 2+Gb iso file for DVD to get Linux? I'm glad you asked. Here are just a few reasons:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Privacy. Boot a CD, do anything you want, shut down, and all evidence of your actions are gone.</li>\n<li>With just an optical disc and a USB stick, every computer becomes \"your\" computer. The latest versions of Knoppix let you save preferences and files to USB to retrieve once you've booted. Viruses? What viruses?</li>\n<li>Rescue mode. Here's where you can be the hero of the hour. Boot Knoppix, make necessary fixes to a sick machine's hard drive, reboot, and you're gonna get some major love.</li>\n<li>Play mode. You've heard about Linux, but don't want your highly tweaked main operating system to be destroyed. Boot Knoppix and see what everyone is raving about. Boot some other OS other than Linux. Return to your \"normal\" computer with a simple Ctrl-Alt-Delete.</li>\n<li>Appliance mode. Besides Knoppix, there's tons of specialty live CDs that are tailored for audiences such as Tivo like video recorders, music and sound creation and editing, high end 3-d graphics, games, web publishing, and on and on. Let others do the hard work of combining operating systems, libraries, and applications. All you have to do is plop in a disc, fire up the machine, and start using.</li>\n<li>Test mode. Booting a live CD gives you another operating system to run diagnostic tests on hardware, whether hard drive, memory, CPU, or something else. Your hardware vendor blames the OS? Tell 'em it's time to give you an RMA on that dead whatever.</li>\n<li>Cred mode. When you get to that Monster/Dice/whoever job form and they ask what environments you're familiar with, do you wanna list only one? Of course you don't. Become a real Power User.</li>\n</ul>\n\nTo give you an example of the power of the live CD, the Ubuntu folks decided that their install CD would actually be a live CD. That is, unlike RedHat, where you have to get a special live version, Ubuntu lets you use their single CD to boot immediately to a running OS. If you like it, you can perform an install from this running image. Reboot, and the same computing environment you were using from CD is now safely tucked onto your hard drive. How awesome is that? Try that with Windows 7 and see how far you get.\n\nFor those of you who can't escape the Windows world, there is an option: live CD building tools. One famous exampe is Bart PE. See, unlike the free software Linux world, you can't just download Windows live CDs (that would be what we in the tech world call \"Illegal\"). Rather, you download software that lets you build a live CD ISO file by using data from your own Windows install CD. I've had good luck with one called <a href=\"http://www.ubcd4win.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ultimate Boot CD for Windows</a>.\n\nHave I used live CDs? You betcha. I've done Ubuntu installs, I've tried out other flavors of Linux, I've rescued a few Windows machines from the brink of death. In the last few months I've been using Knoppix to diagnose network configurations with blade servers my team is working with. Having a self-contained OS + complete set of diagnostic tools of all kinds makes it dead easy to figure out where things are Going South.\n\nSo, you've bought into my sales pitch, and you wanna get you some of that there live CD.

If you are not familiar with what Ignite events are, the gist is that presenters have 5 minutes and 20 slides to talk about something. \"Entertain us, but do it fast\". It is basically a week-long conference worth of presentations, ideas, entertainment, and networking in 2 hours!\n\n#IgniteRaleigh had 15 presentations, some good, some bad, some amazing! There were 3 presentations that really stood out in my mind from the night:\n\n<b>19 Reasons why the Triangle is better than Silicon Valley</b> - <a href=\"http://twitter.com/waynesutton\" target=\"_blank\">@waynesutton</a>\nWayne's presentation was awesome! He laid out all the reasons that the Triangle kicks Silicon Valley's tail, and I must say he was spot on. Everything from barbecue to nuts...that's right, apparently Raleigh has <a href=\"http://www.newraleigh.com/images/articles/acorn002_thumb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">\"big nuts\"</a> compared to Silicon Valley...the double entendre was not lost on the crowd ;) He was funny, engaging, and had good info. Exactly what an #IgniteRaleigh presentation should be!\n\n<b>What Would Jesus Tweet?</b> - <a href=\"http://twitter.com/derekbrown\" target=\"_blank\">@derekbrown</a>\nWhen I saw the title of this I figured it would either be really bad or really awesome. I honestly figured it would be some guy preaching about how social media killed religion. To my pleasant surprise, Derek was hilarious and awesome. He basically laid out how to look like a religious zealot on twitter and told how those actions turn people off to your cause...be it religion, business, or whatever. So what <i>would</i> Jesus tweet? \"Follow Me\" DUH!\n\n<b>Bootstrapping - When profit isn't optional.</b> - <a href=\"http://twitter.com/averyj\" target=\"_blank\">@averyj</a>\nThis presentation was aimed right at people like me. Entrepreneurs. Or, in my case, wannabe entrepreneurs. James laid out his suggestions for getting your \"big idea\" up and going, including quitting your job and going solo. His content was great, but his slides made the presentation. All stick guys, all the time! Think <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/\" target=\"_blank\">XKCD</a> #ignite style!\n\nAnd who could forget the entertainment! <a href=\"http://rhettandlink.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rhett and Link</a> performed several songs, including their Facebook song and Barbecue Song. The emcee for the night was @<a href=\"http://twitter.com/zachward\" target=\"_blank\">zachward</a> from the DSI Comedy Theater in Carrboro. He was a good time too, and kept the crowd pumped and the presenters moving! And he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2b1D5w82yU\" target=\"_blank\">Rick Rolled</a> us a time or two as well :)\n\n#IgniteRaleigh was flat out entertaining, sometimes irreverent, totally relevant, and a good time all around. It was great to get plugged into the social media scene in Raleigh, and it was awesome to realize all the immense talent and resources we have just by living in the Triangle. There are a lot of great people out there who \"get it\" and want to help other people \"get it\" too. And it wasn't a room full of your prototypical \"computer guy\". There were people of all ages, professions, backgrounds. It was a melting pot, just like the Triangle area.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend going to #IgniteRaleigh next year.

Recently I got a request from a faculty about any \"trick\" to make Firefox display alt attributes in images as tooltips. This is the default behavior for IE6,7 but no other browser. I'll not re-write the article that informed my response to this faculty, but there's a fantastic discussion about all this on <a href=\"http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200412/the_alt_and_title_attributes/\" target=\"_blank\">456 Berea St.</a>\n\nBasically, here's my take, though it looks like there's not universal agreement:\n<ul>\n<li>the alt attribute for an image should be specified for images when the image is conveying something to your audience. If for whatever reason a visitor can't see your images, they'll instead see, or be read more likely, the text given for an alt attribute. Thus, write good alt attribute text - and keep it brief. See the article above for more details on what to write and when.</li>\n<li>Use the the title attribute for Tool Tips. The title attribute should NOT be the same as the alt attribute. A screen reader would read the same text twice to a visitor who can't see images, so that's not helpful. A title attribute is instead intended to give extra information - for example, when a picture was taken, who the photographer was, or something else. (Aside: this isn't exactly semantic, but that's okay for now I suppose).</li>\n</ul>\n\nThis blogpost will probably bore the hell out of many of you, but I think it's a neat little subtlety in HTML. What do you think, am I missing something? One other note, IE8 correctly does not display alt attribute text as a tool tip.\n\nps. alt attribute. not alt tag.","createdDate":"2009-07-31T12:52:08.000Z","updatedDate":"2014-10-05T21:49:42.990Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2009-07-31T12:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:8146","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"Often, for automatically generated alt tags and tool tips, these values will be equal.

After all, they are the one who chose to read the data, they should be responsible for determining if the data should be read again if it is duplicate.\n\nDefinitely if you can set them manually, they should be different values. However, if the alt attribute fills the gap of what the image is attempting to convey, then both the sighted and blind individual should be given a followup piece of information that relates to the image because we can assume that they understand the context now for the title attribute's commentary.","createdDate":"2009-07-31T13:55:54.000Z"}]},{"id":"2486881:BlogPost:7365","contributorName":"1m89sv3p0ar0c","title":"Open Conference Systems","description":"We have been working, over in Engineering, on creating an instance of the <a href=\"http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ocs\" target=\"_blank\">Open Conference Systems</a> (OCS) conference management system.

This topic is a little more focused than those discussions, so I thought I'd go for the blog post approach.\n\nThe topic of making your organization's web applications look like the organization's websites has been one that's come up over the past few weeks and is one that I have strong opinions about. It's important to state that I don't believe that all your organization's web applications should look like its websites in every single case. There are clearly instances where you might desire just such a look. But, generally speaking, I believe there are significant usability issues associated with making every thing look exactly the same.\n\nIt's a popular belief that having an identical layout for everything will make the user experience seamless. I think this is completely untrue for the majority of cases. Distinct functionality, audience, and purpose should dictate design.\n\nOn that note, let's look at a couple of example scenarios.\n\nLet's say on your website, you've got a navigation bar with some links on it: \"Home, Services, About, Pricing.\" Now you've also got a search box that searches your site in the header as well. Your website contains information on your company and what you do.\n\nNow enter a web application that has the same look and feel as the website (the nav bar is in the same place, it has the same header, it's got a search box, etc.) This web application is designed to be used for entering reports for your company. The nav bar has a completely different set of links than the website though: \"Create A Report, View Reports, Archive.\" And the search box searches the application in the reports that the system knows about.\n\nIf you are a user and you end up going from the website to the application, you might be thrown off when the links you were used to seeing disappear and the search box no longer returns the data you thought it would.\n\nThis whole problem stems from the fact that the web application has no unique identity to separate it from the website. The web application is clearly a different entity with a unique purpose unrelated to the website's information. Giving the application it's own look and feel helps cue the user into the fact that they are not on the website anymore, but are in an application that has a specific purpose.\n\nThis purpose is communicated through the design of the application. If you don't design the software with the purpose and audience in mind, then you are going to end up sacrificing the usability and identity of the web application. The same goes for websites. You design a website with a specific purpose in mind. These design goals may occasionally overlap, but are very distinct more often than not.\n\nA web application is no different from any desktop application you may have installed. The only difference is the platform. Your email client or instant messaging client that runs on your desktop has its own look and feel and a distinct set of functions that separates it from every other application. It was designed with a specific purpose in mind. If organizational web applications are required to look like the organization website, then so should every desktop application that the organization sanctions (email client, messaging client, anti-virus clients, calendar clients, etc.) But no one expects those to look like everything else. I don't recognize a difference between your desktop email client and any web application. They're pieces of software that have a distinct purpose and identity and were designed with a specific set of tasks in mind.\n\nThat being said, I do believe there is a lot of value in having a brand identity for applications that are all part of the same suite or multiple applications all provided by one umbrella organization. This would include things like company logos or a common link box at the bottom of the page. This is evident in Google's set of web applications. Their web applications all have their own look and feel while being tied together by a small set of links at the top and occasionally a Google logo and a small set of links at the bottom with the copyright. Below are screen shots of Google owned applications: Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs, Picasa Web Albums, Google Reader, Blogger, YouTube, and Orkut.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"blogs/11-gmail2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"blogs/12-gmail2.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"197\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"blogs/13-cal2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"blogs/14-cal2.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"blogs/15-docs2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"blogs/16-docs2.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"blogs/17-picasa2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"blogs/18-picasa2.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"197\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"blogs/19-reader2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"blogs/20-reader2.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"195\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"blogs/21-blogger2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"blogs/22-blogger2.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"197\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"blogs/23-youtube.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"blogs/24-youtube.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"195\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"blogs/25-orkut2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"blogs/26-orkut2.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"196\"/></a></p>\n\nAnd below is a screen shot of Google's \"About\" website. This is about the closest thing to a website that I think they have, as Google.com is a web application.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"blogs/27-about.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"blogs/28-about.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\"/></a></p>\n\nThe same thing applies to traditional fat applications that applies to the Google application family. You can easily recognize a product from the Google family just as you can an application in the Adobe or Microsoft family without them having to look and function identically. They have a few elements that are similar and that's more than enough to let the user know what they're dealing with.\n\nThe solution to this problem is threefold:\n\n1) A mindset change is necessary. People need to realize that web applications are no different than desktop applications aside from the platform on which they run and the fact that they are designed to accomplish a specific task or set of tasks. You don't expect Word to look like Internet Explorer, so you should not expect Gmail to look like Picasa Web Albums.\n\n2) Don't make your web applications look like your websites. It's that simple. Unless there's a really good reason to do so, just avoid it. Give your web applications a distinct identity and make them recognizable as such. Your users will thank you.\n\n3) Trust your branding. Having a central logo or small identifying footer will be enough for your users to recognize that they're in one of your applications.","createdDate":"2009-04-22T13:31:42.000Z","updatedDate":"2014-09-29T11:44:10.433Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2009-04-22T15:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:6026","contributorName":"3eskgaralqbpn","description":"We face the same challenge, but since we're at ECU, the issue is less a problem with our \"pirate\" themed names as the almost iron bound requirement that the color scheme have some variation of purple and gold.","createdDate":"2009-04-28T14:30:51.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:5883","contributorName":"2k7vvpf9lb3q6","description":"Great post Garrison.

I'd offer to widen the perspective a bit. And my original post certainly didn't do this. It is posted on a forum of \"web developers\" and for us to be in \"the middle of it\" helps imply in a sense, that it is somehow this web thing that will undo the University like the newspaper. And then taking the given that the faculty != newspapers - it seems to kill the start of the discussion.\n\nThe thing is, this isn't really about 'web sites' and it isn't about 'the online Academy' I certainly don't think that the static web is a replacement for the personal interaction. And I certainly don't think that the interaction here, or in lists, or other spaces is a replacement for physicality - anymore than I think a Kindle is a replacement for a physical book.\n\nBut what the web did do, after a time, was begin to model the interaction we want - it's become yet another way in which we connect with others to contextualize that consumption of information. You see - we want that interaction - that connection - that \"actually going to school and learning from these folks\" - of course we can get that commoditized static information from all sorts of locations - what we can't really get is the context. Most professional journalists can describe things, can frame things, can contextualize things in ways many - most - of the rest of us can't. The same with professional faculty.\n\nAnd that's where the metaphor begins to come into focus - for me at least. What do we have now? For many institutions - we are trying to take this complex, dynamic interaction, that chaotic, layered, progression - that process of learning - and convert it into \"learning objects\" - to static packaged modules, to click-by-click page turners - to things that can be distributed in perfect digital copies that we can build walls around, package in our DRM, struggle to protect them in copyright - wrap them up in our \"accredited certification\" - and all of those things that the newspapers completely failed at - because people can get that from wikipedia a lot better than they can get them from us.\n\nDisavowing what's emerging online means disavowing a revolutionary, technology enabled way to do what we have done for as long as we've existed - interact and communicate and learn and teach. And if the universities don't wake up to that, that's where I think that the comparison to the newspapers carries some validity.","createdDate":"2009-03-17T01:51:22.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:4726","contributorName":"halmeeks","description":"Are newspapers like universities? Are Railroads like Interstates? Both are impacted by disruptive technologies, but in hindsight we see that they are not the same. In the midst of it though, we are driven to make analogies because that is all we have to describe what is unfolding. Television is Radio with pictures.\n\n\"The problem newspapers face isn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t see the internet coming. \" It wouldn't have mattered if they saw it or not. It is a different thing. It is like printing presses and laser printers. Is it any coincidence that one of the biggest investors in electronic document management and publication research in the 60's and 70's was Xerox (the Star project)? Where are they now? Making copier machines and printers.\n\nXerox machines and laser printers had a major disruptive influence on publication. Everyone could buy an Apple laser printer, page maker, a ton of clip art, and call themselves a designer. The good news was that a percentage of people who were excluded before, due to lack of access to tools, could make nice stuff, but there was/is a lot of crap as well. Could traditional paper designers/printers see this coming? Would it have mattered?\n\nThe more time I spend working towards being a designer, the more I appreciate paper design -- and note -- I used to ridicule paper designers as not \"getting it\" when it comes to fully end to end digital design. I went to a presentation by a dutch designer on Friday -- who designs digitally, but everything is printed on an offset press with water based inks. I could fake what he is doing in photoshop, but it will always be a cheap imitation. I won't be able to fully emulate interaction of ink with paper, including overprinting.\n\nI would never have known any of this <i>without actually going to school and learning from these folks.</i> I would not have had this experience through a blog, through facebook, through 2nd life etc. This is the value of studying design in a physical location versus just reading a bunch of web sites on \"killer photoshop techniques\".\n\n\"The problem with software is that everyone has it.\" (One of my favorite quotes). It isn't and never has been entirely about access to tools. The \"internet revolution\" levels the playing field, but it is really about what we do with it. Making stuff, looking at stuff, thinking about stuff. A video camera in one hand is a youtube video about skateboarding dog, in someone else's hands, a work of enduring beauty.\n\nIn education, those that just want to get their ticket punched will figure out, in the future, a way to get that done. Perhaps it will be through an online university in China or India, which can hire faculty for a fraction of what it costs elsewhere. Your piece of paper can say whatever you want on it. Perhaps MIT will franchise itself, so your diploma will say MIT, even though you never worked with any faculty housed in Boston. For many jobs, it is more about what you can do than what this piece of paper says you can do. This is the case of the program I am in -- lots of professional designers do not have any sort of degree in graphic design. They have a killer portfolio of work.\n\nHowever, for some disciplines -- that piece of paper is everything. Civil Engineering, Architecture etc. Shake your fist that those damn organizations that require certification that demonstrates you are competent to build a bridge or skyscraper. Haven't they heard of the internet! I can just download some plans and build it myself!\n\nI found the article in question to be generally well written, but it is hardly a new idea -- I would recommend Walter Benjamin's essay \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\", written in the 1930's -- as a place to start. And -- guess what -- it is on the internet, freely available.\n\n--hal","createdDate":"2009-03-16T21:05:43.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:4699","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"The problem with comparing the newspaper industry to higher education is that it is much more difficult (currently) to share a teacher.\n\nThe reason that we still have higher educated as walled gardens is that there is value placed on degrees from accredited institutions. Additionally, when it starts to get really competitive, people can choose name brands because they feel comforting (Wall Street Journal, MIT). People come to NC State for two related reasons: people will accept their degree as proof of their knowledge of the subject, and people expect to learn the subject matter to the required level for success in that field. This requires that the institution have a rigorous set of course material with a set of guidelines for ensuring that the minimum instruction has been delivered. If you fail to meet those guidelines, you rightly lose your accreditation.\n\nPeople don't trust the degrees from an educational institution which is not accredited. Sure, you could learn some stuff, but how can we know that you really received the quality of education which we list as required on the job listing? We spend a lot of money to employ intelligent individuals and draw them from around the world. To a certain extent, this keeps the pool of highly qualified individuals who are not working in a walled garden to a minimum, making it much more difficult for high quality education to be \"Public Domain\"-style available.\n\nWith newspapers, we have high quality work delivered to a massive audience. Feedback is not a required aspect. With education, the individuals (who we'll assume can receive the high quality work) must provide feedback so that their understanding of the subject can be evaluated. If we assume the same teaching methods, the same people who couldn't be successful in courses would not suddenly become successful.\n\nSo let's describe the unthinkable (so that it is therefore thinkable): a high quality, widely available information source and feedback system which is accredited in such a way as to guarantee the authenticity of both the system itself and the users which are given rights hereunto by said system. Given that, we now sit a user down at a computer, they access the United Earth University system, and take their course, in their language. Now degrees are universally accepted, many more courses are available than were previously, collaboration and research efforts push the boundary of human knowledge and everyone wins.... right?\n\nYes and no. Newspapers might be dying right now, but that's not because the information is widely available; it is because the infrastructure is redundant. People still get paid to find the story, do some research, and write it up. They just sell it to the global information source instead of Little City Times. The globalization of newspapers means that you start getting New York Times for the same price in San Francisco as in New York (yay franchise). The \"Local\" section of the paper will be customized for the region. Dominant individuals in the market will still be around because they are the centralized infrastructure. It's not that news or higher learning go away, it just becomes stronger. Really, the model for us should be to plan for this. By increasing our scalability, we can be the global university (or at least a major player in the federation of global universities). Of course, I think the people who will see the least change (are the least scalable) are the proctors, because as we've seen with the video cameras and other measures used to ensure GRE and TOEFL takers aren't cheating or hiring professional test takers, to trust that the users know the material we need to trust that it was the users themselves who provided the feedback.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but it seems like people are drawing the wrong conclusions because this is the chaotic transformation period and they don't extrapolate to the hindsight which seems clear to me (and this article hints at, albeit unknowingly). Things which have value will still have value, but redundancy is only valuable if someone feels like spending the extra dollar for it. When the money isn't there, redundancy goes away.\n\nPeople need to hurry up and deliver their last newspaper as digital paper so the \"news\" is downloaded each day (for much less than it used to cost \"back in my day\"), customized for and/or by the user, widely available, and economically sustainable. Niche markets will still exist to fill the gaps, and people will subscribe (think RSS) to them if they want to get news about them.","createdDate":"2009-03-16T14:00:21.000Z"}]},{"id":"2486881:BlogPost:4643","contributorName":"3p7bzgj31hmap","title":"Simple Viewer","description":"Over the last week I've been doing some searching for embeddable open source image gallery tools with the requirement being ease of use in creating new galleries.

I actually like using different colors than red/grey/black/white :) Something that may add some pop is to make the meter part (that is currently red) a darker version of the pastel it is on (IE, dark green w/ pastel green). That may not get your point across about being unavailable, but I'd be interested to see how it looked.\n\nJust my thoughts....nice job all around.

Most of the time, they are just entertainment for entertainments sake, but I had a revelation while watching LOST relating to the way our University (dis)functions.\n\nIf you think I am going to compare some administrator to \"the others\", or call another one the smoke monster, you'd be wrong. No, what got me was at the end of season 2 where Jack was talking to his people and he told them \"if we don't live together, we will die alone\". This got me thinking about how this applies to our University (I know, total nerd), especially relating to the economic hardships we are in. We've seen some tough economic times in my time here, but nothing like this. Talk of salary cuts, furloughs for faculty, RIFs, etc. It is all very terrifying. It is times like this where we have to make sure what we are doing brings value to the University.\n\nSo how does LOST == NCSU? It is my belief that if we, members of the University at the most basic level, don't start collaborating across unit, division, college, wherever... then we're going to see our funding and jobs disappear.\n\nYour initial thought to that statement may be \"we already collaborate\". True, there are some pockets of true collaboration going on around campus, but it is far too little in my opinion. We have pockets of people, separated by units and divisions and colleges, all doing their own thing. It's been this way for years, and it's what people are comfortable with. But it's not enough.\n\nPeople are doing some really great work...the only problem is that the only folks who benefit from it are the folks in a single department or division. We have a hard time thinking about the University as a whole when we create things. This makes us even more disjointed, and it means that we have people all over the place (possibly) working on the EXACT same problem. So what do we do about that? How can we collaborate and make the University better with every hour of our time at work? We collaborate, and get the most bang for our buck.\n\nWith collaboration comes some huge challenges. From my perspective, here are the ones that stand out the most:\n\n<b>1: Trust</b>\nI see this all the time. Unit A doesn't trust Unit B, so Unit A doesn't talk to Unit B and just does it themselves. It is a very hard thing to put your trust in people, but to truly collaborate, you gotta do it. Yeah, people may disappoint you sometimes, and you may fail because of it. But you have to have some faith in people. I can't speak for everyone, but I assure you that if I have a job to do, I am going to do it 100%, because I hate to fail. I am sure I am not the only one out there that feels like that.\n\n<b>2: \"This will never work\"</b>\nAgain, something I hear more than I want to. It's the employee who assumes a project is going to fail before it is even tried. My response is always \"how do you know?\".....\"it just will\". That's really not a very productive attitude to have. If you don't try, you can never succeed. And even if you fail, you learn just as much then as you do when you succeed. Part of this idea comes from my background as an Engineer. We embrace failure because we see it as one step closer to a success. Anyway, nothing gets in the way of collaboration more than someone who is unwilling to try.\n\n<b>3: Pushing work off on other people because you are too busy</b>\nI quite often hear this as well. I personally feel like that sometimes...it's like \"how can I take on anything else?\". Just understand that you aren't the only ones who are extremely busy right now. We are all being asked to take on more as budgets and positions get cut. But the only way we are going to make it through is by getting others to help us. What better to get their help than to offer to help them with something?\n\n<b>4: University Politics</b>\nThis is the most, in my opinion, absurd reason to avoid collaboration. \"Somebody made me mad 10 years ago, so I can't trust any of those people\". 3 words....\"get over it\". How politically correct was that? :)\n\n<b>5: Personal Ownership</b>\nThis is one of the largest hurdles of collaboration. Folks are way to concerned over whether or not they will get \"credit\" for something. They are afraid to work with someone else for fear that all the glories won't be bestowed on them. This is a hard one to overcome because many folks tie personal gains with self worth, as opposed to team gains. To me, I'd rather my team succeed and me be part of it, than me succeed but my team fail. Take Kobe Bryant for example. He saw that when he scored 50+ points for the Lakers, they were losing more than they were winning. But when he scored 20 and got his teammates involved, they were winning more than they were losing. Coincidence? Nope, collaboration.\n\n\nI am sure there are more things around that make people avoid collaboration, but those are the ones that are the most prominent to me. Don't get me wrong...I understand all these view points to some extent, I just don't think they are relevant. And I think some folks need to get over their personal feelings and do what is best for the University, not their professional future. Whether we wanna admit it all the time, we are a team, and when the team succeeds, we ALL look good. When our team fails, we ALL look bad.\n\nI think collaboration is our greatest tool, but one that stays in the toolbox all too often. We can no longer depend on other people to be the ones to collaborate, and us just sit back and benefit from that. My challenge to all of us is to get off our rears and spark the process. Will you get resistance from above? Probably. At that point, you have two options. Maintain the status quo, or \"challenge the process\" and move the University in a positive direction. We have the power to make a difference here, and hopefully, keep our jobs in the process :)","createdDate":"2009-02-06T14:18:08.000Z","updatedDate":"2014-10-05T14:58:44.037Z","approved":"Y","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2009-02-06T15:09:46.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:3261","contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","description":"Like Billy, now that i've made it all the way through the discussion, i feel i must add to it. I have only been here at NCSU for 6.5 months now, so take this with a grain of salt. It is also monday morning on a day i don't feel 100%, so i hope this all makes sense. If i waited till mid week to write, the moment would be lost i feel.\n\nIn my previous life as an employee at a small private college, it was not as important or difficult to intentionally communicate and/or collaborate. There weren't enough people to spread around, so if you were working on something, chances were that you were the only person working on it. People knew what you were working on, because pretty much anything anyone did was of dire importance to the survival of the institution in some way or form. We knew each other outside of work for the most part too, so it was fairly easy to keep people informed of any projects that would affect them.\n\nAt NCSU, i am cognizant of the fact that NCSU is a different animal (insert creative Bobcat versus Wolf analogy here). This is a much bigger place, which makes it very easier to (a) get closed off in our own little areas, or (b) find it difficult to navigate the layers of bureaucracy and organizational structure (so we don't even try). I now work closely with a great bunch of people (shout outs especially to Jen, Jason, Garrison) who explicitly, intentionally, and logically make the effort to communicate and collaborate with. I don't know if it's an generational thing, a yet-to-be-jaded thing, or just that we seem to like each other for more than just work-related purposes, but it seems we are more willing to put in effort to create, correct, or cancel things that will ultimately help the university as a whole. I'll insert my disclaimer here, that i do not mean that others are not helping, or others aren't doing their part. I can only speak to my personal experience, which so far is fairly small i admit.\n\nAnyway, the point i was trying to get around to, is that we have started down the right path in the web developers community. It is difficult to foresee how our efforts of open communication and collaboration will permeate upwards (and downwards as the case may be). It is not important to see the end-goal, because it will continue to be a moving target. I don't think you can ever reach a point at which communication or collaboration are as good as they can get. It IS important though to keep focused on the principles throughout this evolution. If we all start implementing some effective changes in our own areas, then those efforts will combine to form some kind of super-collaboration-communication-hybrid-entity..kinda like voltron, devastator, predacon or any other from the cartoon analogy archives (but it would be for good, not evil).\n\nEffective communication and collaboration does not mean more committees, although it could. It does not mean more time spent talking, although it could. It simply could mean that you post your existing minutes AND people actually read them. It could mean that you use <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com\">twitter</a> AND encourage your colleagues to use it too.\n\nThe way i envision communication and collaboration, is that these efforts are meant to make us more efficient and effective in what we already do. Like Jason said...if someone else has already solved 80% of the problem, i sure dont want to spend time solving that same thing. Maybe if someone tweeted about their project, i would have known, and would have stopped earlier.\n\nAnyway, this is long winded, i've been interrupted several times since starting this post an hour ago. If i don't hit the button now, i may not get to...","createdDate":"2009-02-09T13:36:19.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:3241","contributorName":"2svjysi3vj2qk","description":"I guess since I put in the effort to make it through all that text, I should post something. I don't use the word \"collaborate\" unless someone else has already used it, and generally only in meetings. To me it doesn't really mean much. I suppose collaborating involves alot of talk (er... communication) and maybe sharing some code. I prefer \"partnerships\". A \"partnership\" is collaborating where someone's ass is on the line. If we partner on a project and I fail, I take you down with me. So I won't fail.\n\nOn a day to day basis, it is so much easier to crawl off into my little hole and ignore everyone else and do my own thing. I know that, I feel it in my bones every day at work, and I know others are afflicted by that same feeling. Its easier, more secure to give into that sort of fear. So I stick my neck out, and try or force others to do so simply to fight the halfassedness of most collaboration attempts. My staff I'm sure hates me just a little bit for it, because every time we fail it affects someone else outside of our group. My biggest problem is that people have the option to not work together. When I hear numbers of how much money is spent on \"IT\" in this university, and I get sick. Because their are alot, A LOT, of people who are not getting their money's worth. So my aim is to build a web of interdependence so difficult for the different IT units to back out of that they stop trying.\n\nI guess that fits for some definitions of collaboration. Maybe someone with a better command of the language could work in another ID4 reference here, but not me. I'm too busy singing the Fresh Prince theme in my head. ;) So I (and my staff) will totally jump on another collaboration bandwagon.

And not just Drupal, but 3rd party application modules, plugins, templates, etc. Lots of pockets of this kind of stuff is going on, and I think the whole could benefit from the sum of the parts here.\n\nMarketing (can't get much broader than that really) is another, and what I mean by marketing is the forward facing \"image\" of the University and it's parts. Web design, fund raising campaigns, marketing materials, unified messages, etc. Lump in social networking and how colleges are using that effectively, and you have a whole slew of challenges to look at.\n\nAlso, from my own area, Billboard and digital signage. Web hosting is a big one, as we have mentioned before. The student email initiative is another project that I am seeing some great collaboration on.\n\nIt's available in a lot of places, and I have a lot of ideas for other \"campus wide\" projects that we all could benefit from. A couple things to consider are a University iPhone application, a collection of data feeds from all sorts of campus resources that people can use to create new and useful applications, a text messaging service to deliver NCSU news, events, bus schedules, etc...a \"code repository\" for projects that are going on around campus, especially related to 3rd party plugins and modules.

It comes from lots of places, but rarely from those 'in the trenches'.\"\n\nUnfortunately there's not all that we can do about that. Speaking as the complete total absolute king of getting frustrated, it doesn't change anything. All that can be done is to do what we feel is the right thing. Here's where I get to invoke my favorite movie of all time, and you somehow, someway have to not get institutionalized by our own Shawshank here. There are an awful lot of institutionalized people here that grew up and came of age in a different era, shaped by their experience and the groups they are in. I'm still shaped for both the good and a few not so good areas, but the politics in which I came into (and contributed to) when I started here. Some of those people need to retire. Some need to be edumacated. Probably at some point some of them just have to be ignored. Thankfully because I'm too young to retire, I've had moments of both of the latter directed at me appropriately over the years.\n\nMy new favorite tactic to resistance (and not the good second-guessing resistance kind, but the kind that says 'I don't want to do that, and you shouldn't want to either') is the \"Well, okay. Maybe this just isn't for you. Maybe you are the type of worker that can do this kind of task\" That usually shocks the good ones back into reality of doing something different. That that don't, well, you route around the damage.\n\nThere are some really bad managers on this campus. Who will put their employees in the tight spot of not 'communicating' - much less 'collaborating' - and threaten their jobs if they do. I hope they are rare, or maybe I've just been lucky to not have them. And hopefully when I was one, I wasn't that. (I'm sure I was quite awful in other ways :-). At worse, many of the others are just apathetic. At the end of the day, those \"in the trenches\" that really want to do something right (and we all know that \"right\" is working and communicating with others) may not get much support, but it's not like they'll actively stand in the way. And when they do, lock the door and play the Opera singers to the whole prison. I'll write a letter a week myself to their bosses. They'll get out of the way just to shut me up :-)\n\nBut getting back to those words we are throwing around - that \"communication\" and \"collaboration\" thing? I'm reminded of another quote:\n\n<blockquote>Parole Dude: Ellis Boyd Redding, your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence. Do you feel you've been rehabilitated? Red: Rehabilitated? Well, now let me see. You know, I don't have any idea what that means.\nParole Dude: Well, it means that you're ready to rejoin society...\nRed: I know what *you* think it means, sonny. To me it's just a made up word. A politician's word, so young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie, and have a job. What do you really want to know?</blockquote>\n\nI guess that jaded part of me comes back - \"Collaboration\" is just a made up word. A word that a lot of people that go to a lot of meetings toss around to make everyone feel good or chagrined as the case may be. So is \"communication\". It's a word that you go to a meeting, have a discussion \"we must communicate! we must collaborate!\" and everyone shakes their head and says \"hear! hear!\" I know - I've uttered both myself a thousand times to further the argument or win the day or sound good. All the while dancing around the real issues at hand.\n\nWhile I'd totally agree that even the made \"communication\" and \"collaboration\" words aren't the same thing and that \"communication\" isn't \"collaboration\" - until it happens that what we *are* working on is in the open - you can forget about even having the foggiest idea that you and me are working on 80% of the same problem.\n\nSo, I'll come back to it again. I'll be damn good money that anyone reading this thread believes in both as that ephemeral ideal. \"We must collaborate!\"\n\nBut what does it really mean? And what are we going to do about it? What problem do we have before us, right now, that could use some good old collaborating on? It sounds like you've started on one (web hosting) - and I can't applaud enough seeing meeting notes, discussions, ideas, out there in the open (though PDF notes? come on man, this is the web ;-). Are there others before us corporately right now?","createdDate":"2009-02-08T16:42:36.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:3223","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","description":"Thanks for you post Jason...knew I could count on you for your $0.02 :)....or that could have been a whole dollar worth of stuff. Either way...thanks for responding.\n\nLemme clear up your questions about what I was meaning when talking about creating projects while thinking about the \"University\". In no way do I mean that every project has to be scalable, redundant, whatever. My point was that we (and by we, I mean my own working group and most every other un-named workgroup that I have been in) struggle with saying \"How does this affect others at the University besides the ones directly involved or targeted\". It is more about consideration of other folks around campus than it is about the scope or target of the project. We so often want to develop in a vacuum for various reasons. My opinion is that we need to step our of our comfort zone from early on and say \"does this impact other people?\", \"Can someone else on campus help us out?\", \"Has someone already solved 80% of this problem\". We, as a University, don't do that enough.\n\nThat segues nicely into your second point about it being beneficial for multiple groups to be working on the same problem. Your reasoning is fine, but I think my point is different. When you read Dr. Hoit's interview that I will (hopefully) post first of next week, you will hear him talk about collaboration. His point was that if OIT is working on some project, and Engineering is working on a similar project, perhaps we have 80% of that problem in common. The other 20% is of a different scope or for a different target audience, but it is 80% the same problem. So lets get together and solve that 80%, and leave the other 20% for the individual groups to solve. That was the point I was getting at.\n\nWe don't have to always do everything together....that'd be extremely difficult and probably wouldn't get much done....but we need to consider that we don't operate in a vacuum and that we have something to be gained by the folks around us.\n\nI'd also like to point out that communication != collaboration. Collaboration can only exist with communication, but communication can exist without collaboration. You can communicate to people all day long, but if you don't in turn listen to them, and include them in the process, then you are merely dictating to them and not collaborating with them. OIT/ITD was guilty of this...and I'm sure many other groups are/were as well. Communicating with each other is a good start, and one that we probably have never done effectively. This site is a good start, but it's not enough to just let everyone know what you are doing. This place can be a heckuva resource (as I personally have found out) to get the right people together in the right room to solve a problem (see our web hosting discussion).\n\nFinally, I don't know what we are going to do about it. I'm trying very hard in my daily work to ask myself \"does this benefit someone besides me?\". If it does, I try to get the word out. I guess the inspiration of this post was that when I am doing that, I am getting resistance and it frustrates me. It comes from lots of places, but rarely from those \"in the trenches\". My hope was that there would be a grassroots uprising and some of those road blocks that keep getting thrown up would slowly start to come down. And even if they don't, maybe we could get some tools to break through them. So maybe, when we get to those roadblocks, we can say \"hello you alien a**holes, I'm baaaaaaaaaaaack\" and boom, their primary weapon goes down, we smoke a victory dance, and all go home happy.....See, you aren't the only one with ID4 scenarios :)","createdDate":"2009-02-08T15:31:37.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:3201","contributorName":"1ou9m4evpyyeo","description":"Ah, if only life were like the movies...

Today we celebrate our independence day!\"\n\nCaptain Billy Beaudoin Hiller: \"Let's do this! Wait a minute? Let's do this?!? What moron wrote this line? I wouldn't say 'let's do this!' I might be like like 'Yippee Kai Yay M**F**' But not let's do this. Wait, what's my motivation for this scene again?\"\n\nJay Young Levinson: \"You've got to be kidding me. Upload a virus from this Mac?!? Using what exactly? This is Nineteen-freakin Ninety Six Do you really think that their wireless protocols are that insecure. HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE SHIELDS?\"\n\nOr something like that. Wait, maybe life is like the movies. Although really, I look nothing like Jeff Goldblum. But it's my story, so I get to be the whiny geek hero.\n\nFirst and foremost. I'm all for this. Totally, and completely, and absolutely for this collaboration thing. And I think, whether it seems like, or feels like it, or looks like it - the very fact that this ning forum exists is building a foundation for collaboration because it's getting people talking, laughing, exploring on a personal level. That's the first step in a journey of a thousand miles. I read that on a fortune cookie once. (But not in bed you cheeky buggers).\n\nAnd I agree with those 5 things you mentioned, trust, politics, killing ideas before they start (I'm incredibly guilty of that one), the fear of taking things on (and excusing it for being too busy) and particularly those things you might not get credit for (let me tell some faculty stories about that latter one). There's some things that I'd add about values and goals. But we'll get to that, though maybe not in this post.\n\nBut there are two things that I'll completely and vociferously disagree with. Both happened in the same sentence. This one:\n\n<blockquote>\"We have a hard time thinking about the University as a whole when we create things. This makes us even more disjointed, and it means that we have people all over the place (possibly) working on the EXACT same problem.\"</blockquote>\n\nOne, I'm not really sure what this 'University' thing means. I mean, there was the fabulous 'We All Go To NC State' campaign, our best ever in my not so humble opinion. I get that one. But I'm not sure I get 'University' here. The University is a pretty big place. Bigger than any of our individual capacity to comprehend it (and the group of those that think they do - um, no, they don't) It's like saying \"think of America when you build your web app\". I picked on Jason Austin one time before when he said - I think in a blog somewhere - \"the University doesn't yet run PHP5\". And I'm \"like, um, yeah, we do. I have been for some time.\" Am I \"University\"? Sure I am. \"I am NC State\" (new slogan coming to an ad campaign near you). And no I'm not - it would be absurdly arrogant to extend myself to that. Same for any one or any group. I am no more or less the \"University\" than Jason or Nick or Charlie or Billy or Fred or OIT or CNR or Student Media, or anyone else.\n\n\"University\" is so big that it means different things to different people. At different times. What does it mean here? I haven't the foggiest.\n\nWhat I have seen, and I know (or hope) Jason doesn't mean this is that \"University\" somehow becomes \"This Service Must Run For 26,000 Faculty Staff and Students With Super Crazy Generator Backed Fault Tolerant Climate Controlled Data Room Protection And In a Hermetically Sealed Jar on the Front Porch of Funk and Wagnalls\" Which is absurd, because outside of a very, very few very constrained feature set services, what we do doesn't scale to that, and damn sure doesn't need to.\n\nThe point (yes there is one, maybe) is, and coming from someone that writes and does systems for apps for an audience both narrower and broader than the 'University' - is that scale doesn't matter. What matters is \"what is the problem? can I help solve this problem with technology? Will it make a difference? And is it worth it? And am I willing to share?\" The values matter. Because I guarantee that if I get some of those details right, than what I do has some applicability in a broader context. Maybe even that \"University\" thing. (or a 16 campus thing. or an entire \"Land Grant system\" thing. Or a My Country Tis of Thee thing, or a I'd like to buy the world a coke thing, or maybe even better, just than one, just one, student that is able to use my work to make a difference in his or her life thing).\n\nOh, and it's okay to work on the same EXACT problem in multiple places. It's the only way to learn. I guarantee you that every web developer here has solved some of the same EXACT problems - and the only way we ever learned was suffering through that. Hell, in 12 years now at this fine University (there's that world again). I guarantee I've solved my own same EXACT problems more than once. (and yes, I've done the same thing over and over and gotten different results, take that Einstein). Much of that is contextual - meaning that the inputs were a little different, and the surrounding processes were a little different, and the outcomes a lot different.\n\nIt's totally, completely, absolutely ok to duplicate services. Probably not to the same group of people. At least not at the same time. But the context matters. It took me a long time, and three different working environments, to feel good about that. But it's the only way to learn, to grow, and to develop a common understanding of a problem. Because when the context changes, the results can change. I gave up a long time ago, as I'm sure others have done with me, when I'd say \"hey I'm working on XYZ\" and colleagues that will remain nameless would go \"Why are you doing that? You shouldn't do that, We already do that, and you don't need to do that too\" It's not really that much different than \"This will never work.\" I mean, really, if you want to talk about effort duplication, we should just shut down all of the \"University\" IT groups. Because we all do the same exact things that IBM IT does. And Microsoft IT. And the IT group at UNC Chapel Hill, and that John Hodgman fellow on the Mac vs. PC commercials...\n\nThe funny, ironic, paradoxical thing? I'd strongly offer that we need more \"disjointed\" \"separate\" \"working on the same problems\" teams. There are way more problems than what we are addressing right now. We need more people doing it, in smaller, more focused, more nimble, flatter, groups that have connections with each other in ways that let them come together when needed to solve problems. Networks work best by pushing the smarts out to the edges, and identifying the core connectors in between.\n\nSo, collaboration is awesome. But let's drill it down, and examine it, and really focus on what the word means, and more importantly what it needs. So-called effort duplication and focusing on different scopes and scales really aren't the issues I don't think. What is? Well, there's the five things you mentioned. And there's that \"values\" thing. But all those are attitudes and feelings and frames of mind. Nothing really that puts the rubber on the road.\n\nThat leaves the whole \"what problems are we really focused on solving\" question. And maybe just the \"let's just freaking talk to each other about what we are working on\" concept. Hell, just working on that last one would go a long, long, long way to something resembling something that can be called collaboration.\n\nAnd then there are aliens. With incredibly insecure uplink protocols.\n\nThe real question is, now that we know it, and we've started a discussion on it. What are our values? How do we come to agreement on those? What can we identify as areas for collaboration? (e.g. what problems do we have that need solving) How do we apply our values and ourselves to solving those?\n\nMaybe the core point, of this long rambly (you wouldn't expect anything less, now would you?) post is this:\n\nI grok the blog post, I'm totally inspired. Yippee Kai Yay. (For real, I'm not being facetious even if the post sounds like it, it's not, it's just meant to be borderline funny and serious at the same time.)\n\nBut the real issue is - what are we going to do about it?","createdDate":"2009-02-08T05:19:40.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:3181","contributorName":"2svjysi3vj2qk","description":"I can dig it.","createdDate":"2009-02-07T04:41:39.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:3173","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","description":"^ done and done.

In the web world we live in, if we take 6 months to evaluate something as a failure, the entire industry has passed us by and we are left with an out-of-date, busted piece of software that really didn't accomplish the task at hand. It is always important to evaluate your success or failure quickly, so the correct changes can be made quickly. Failing fast allows you to innovate fast, and it really is a requirement if you wanna keep up.\n\n\"Release early and often\". This goes along with \"failing fast\", but is a little different. It means that you do multiple small releases instead of big, bulky releases. This gives your end users time to get used to new features, design changes, modifications to workflows, etc. It also (as the article states) allows you to keep innovating on a current codebase, and not go through the headache of a \"redesign\".\n\nGreat find Mike!","createdDate":"2009-01-27T13:17:10.000Z"}]},{"id":"2486881:BlogPost:2571","contributorName":"19wgwss45yepg","title":"Drupal 6.9 update","description":"Our Drupal servers were updated to version 6.9 (from 6.8).

That movement did hit some resistance from some of the other groups that use SSL certificates in things other than standard browsers. (LDAP certs, blackberry users, etc) I don't know if they complained to get it to stop, or complained because they wanted to see if it would work with their devices/software before being forced to move.\n\nAs far as webservers are concerned, I think it's a good idea. We probably give Thawte something in the $10-20k range for certs now (based on my poor memory of our contract for 100 or 200 certs, I don't recall clearly which). That's a nice chunk of savings to look forward to.\n\nFor myself, after this successful test, I will probably stop using the NCSU CA and/or self-signed certificates for internal-use websites. webmaildev is one example of this class of server where it needs to be SSL but it's not worth paying Thawte for an internal or dev box.

Why the sudden revelation that all shall bow to Google? Cal-dav support in Google Calendar.\n\nI'm sure most of you who have used a calendaring solution here on campus have had the same struggles that I have. I honestly have never reliably used a calendar to do anything than keep up with work meetings. The occasional personal appointment may find its way there, but only because it would be in the middle of the work day or something. I was basically anti-calendar because there was no way to have \"one version of the truth\". Phone, home, work, anywhere, everywhere...it all should be the same and that seemed to be an impossible feat.\n\nThe other reason is that our university has failed to find any kind of decent calendaring solution (and if you people tell me GroupWise is a great solution, I have some oceanfront property in Montana to sell you). Do calendars really have to be clunky? Do they really require a rocket scientist to figure out something simple? Do they have to be completely crippled to be functional? Do the Mac versions of all of them have to act like pre-alpha software?\n\nHere is where GCal came into play. I had tried out GCal a while back and it was great, but I couldn't run it through iCal and actually put appointments on the calendar. There was also no way to see it on my iPhone through the native calendar client except through iCal, then syncing was a necessity, which I rarely do. Despite the fact that GCal arguably has one of the best calendar interfaces around (easy to use, clean, efficient, simple), I couldn't make myself use it because I wanted my calendar to be the same everywhere.\n\nWith GCal's adding support for cal-dav (<a href=\"http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2008/12/google-calendar-now-supports-apple-ical.html\">announced this week</a>), I finally have (most of) my wish. Now I can use GCal as the sole data source for my calendar data. I can look at it through iCal (or any other app that supports cal-dav), view it on the web through GCal's interface, and seamlessly use it with my iPhone's native calendar app (this is made possible by <a href=\"http://nuevasync.com\">http://nuevasync.com</a> and has nothing to do with cal-dav support, but it's still cool).\n\nNow don't go getting too excited...I still am not 100% synced. Groupwise is still in the picture. I have GW delegating my meetings to GCal, so at least work meetings get on my central calendar, but I can't push meetings back to GW. That means that if I put something on my GCal that needs to make it back to GW, I have to do it manually. If they would just support cal-dav, all would be grand, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.\n\nAnyway, it is much better now than it was, and I am using a calendar for the first time. Google, you rock my face completely off!

I am hoping Nuevasync will eventually let you select which calendars to see, but until then I'd suggest only being the admin of your own calendar and not other peoples.

It was a decent webinar, just to get some information 'from the horse's mouth,' but didnt really fill in any true gaps in my understanding of Drupal's inner workings and intentions. In any case, here's my notes that i jotted down during the hour.\n\n\n* Basic introduction, describing what Drupal is generally about its history.\n\n* \"DeanSpace\" website for Howard Dean's presidential bid in 2004 used Drupal, which seemed to start a little bit of a boom...\"yeaaahhhhhhh.\"\n\n* Trillions of sites use Drupal, or so they say. My mind can't comprehend how many one trillion sites is, let alone trillions of them just using one platform. Okay now they are saying it's just millions of sites instead. Just a slight exaggeration i'm sure.\n\n* <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com\">The Onion</a> runs on Drupal, as does <a href=\"http://www.sonymusic.com/\">Sony Music</a>, <a href=\"http://britney.com\">Britney Spears</a>, <a href=\"http://InMan.com\">InMan.com</a>\n\n* They settled the debate for pronunciation, with the winner being \"Drew Pull,\" like Drew Carey, and like you're pulling a rope.\n\n* I can't believe how inappropriate the attendees are, already (within the first 3 minutes), chatting in the webinar window things like \"yawn\", \"why is this a history lesson\" and \"HOW is DRUPAL better than JOOMLA\" (and yes, all caps were used.\n\n* They gave a fairly good simplification of how Drupal Works:\no User requests page\no drupal plugins parse and process that request\no the sidebars and menus are added\no the theme turns it all into HTML\no and then the page is displayed to the user\n\n* A little \"how does it compare\" to Ruby on Rails, Django, CakePHP as far as frameworks go, and then also Movable Type, Wordpress, or other photo gallery-type products. Didnt really get the point of this, but im sure it will make sense later.\n\n* Ahhh.....so they did that to provide context, saying that Drupal lives in the middle somewhere. Somewhere between a framework, and an out-of-the box function specific CMS.\n\n* Nodes discussion/explanation now.....fairly straught forward.\no nodes are content\no content can be anything you tell it to be\no permissions can be set on content types\n\n* Getting started with Drupal: <a href=\"http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2008/11/getting-started-with-drupal.html\">http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2008/11/getting-started-with-drupal.html</a>\n\n* There is a Drupal IRC Channel -- something like #Drupal\n\n* That just lasted 40 minutes, and now it is question time. This may be more helpful than the actual presentation.\n\n* Lack of OOP is intentional, according to them. When Drupal began, PHP was a thin wrapper on top of C. There was no OOP for PHP at the time, which played into their decision. There is a process wtihin the Drupal core that they are slowly moving pieces to OOP, but it is only in circumstances that require it for a good reason. They are not going to just rewrite it all as OOP from scratch.\n\n* <a href=\"http://drupal.org/handbooks\">http://drupal.org/handbooks</a>\n\n* <a href=\"http://webpub.mit.edu/2008/11/mit-drupal-group-sites/\">http://webpub.mit.edu/2008/11/mit-drupal-group-sites/</a>\n\n* <a href=\"http://chasesagum.com/most-notable-websites-powered-by-drupal-part-1\">http://chasesagum.com/most-notable-websites-powered-by-drupal-part-1</a>\n* From audience: \"Advice to newbies: find drupal listservs for your industry/interest like drupal for libraries (drupal4lib)\"\n\n* The domain module was mentioned in relation to the Multi-site configuration issues: <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/domain\">http://drupal.org/project/domain</a>\n\n* now there are a lot of randomly specific questions\n\n* Wow...this site: <a href=\"http://droge.com/flash\">http://droge.com/flash</a> is Drupal. It is completely Flash on the front end, but on the back end it is all Drupal. It's just a theme that converts it to Flash for the user to see. That's impressive.\n\n* Drupal is optimized for caching and high use sites.\n\n* Drupal community in NC: <a href=\"http://drupalnorthcarolina.org/\">http://drupalnorthcarolina.org/</a>\n\n* Drupal Theme Garden : <a href=\"http://themegarden.org/drupal6\">http://themegarden.org/drupal6</a>\n\n* Top 40 Modules by Lullabot: <a href=\"http://www.lullabot.com/audiocast/drupal_podcast_no_40_top_40_projects\">http://www.lullabot.com/audiocast/drupal_podcast_no_40_top_40_projects</a>\n\n* An Archive of this webinar will be posted here: <a href=\"http://oreilly.com/webcasts/\">http://oreilly.com/webcasts/</a>\n\n* There seemed to be a lot of people saying to stay away from the new Panels2 module at all costs.\n\n\nThat seems to be about it.

How do you think STUDENTS are COMMUNICATING?\n\nHow are we, as IT support folks, going to support our students if we can't speak their language?

I think we HAVE to keep up efforts to do new and innovative things, including changing the way we communicate, buy-in or not. I think a lot of times managers and admins are hesitant of new things (like twitter and IM) because they fear that it will impact the effectiveness of their employees.

The breakdown for that final feedback data set was:\n\n6000 approximate students\n116 individual invitations sent to request participation in the focus group\n21 students attended the focus group meeting(s)\n17 students responded to the questions posed to them\n12 students recommended Live@EDU\n5 students recommended GMail / Google Apps\n\nNow i understand sampling, and the importance of constructing effective population samples to survey, but I thought it was interesting that by the end of the research process, of the 6000 possible opinions, only 17 were used. The sample that was used was not intentionally random or even intentionally representative.\n\nI think it is very necessary to be both intentional in the decisions we make that affect large populations, but also we should be very intentional on how much trust we put in the level of understanding by that sampled population. If we looked at the data from that institution on a purely percentage-basis, it would look like the student population recommended one solution at a rate of 70%. However would you trust that same recommendation if you knew that only 12 out of 6000 actually said so? In order for me to be convinced of that recommendation, i would need a little larger of a sample size, and a little more confidence that the sample size was representative of all students, not just the ones who were motivated enough to participate. The opinions of unmotivated students who don't want to participate in a focus group should not be discounted as people who don't have an opinion on what platform they will use to interact during their college career.\n\nI just found this to be an interesting discussion. It does not mean that they would not have still gone with Live@EDU, but it does cast a little doubt over how many students actually wanted it, or how many students would have chosen Google Apps instead.","createdDate":"2008-11-20T18:51:10.000Z","updatedDate":"2014-10-03T02:54:56.159Z","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2008-11-20T18:51:10.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:848","contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","description":"I will be doing that today.

It seems a little less formal in lots of ways. Perhaps it's the lack of keynote, or session tracks, or something I can't really put my finger on. Either way, it continues to be different than things like ZendCon and the ResNet conference. Here is what was good, and not so good, about UNC Cause 2008:\n\n<b>The Good</b>\n\n* Networking was really good. I met lots of people who are dealing with lots of the same issues our group is. Made some really good connections that I will probably hit up for info later :)\n* Wireless connectivity. It was solid from the very beginning. It would have been great if I could have gotten on it upstairs in the hotel, but it had great coverage in the conference area.\n* Groupwise to iPhone Calendar connector FTW! I am crafting an email to go to our email and calendar lead about this product, cause I want it t-now! In case you missed our previous post, it was by Notify Technology.\n* Breakfast was really good. Better the second day because they had biscuits and gravy :)\n* Twittering at the conference. A small group of people tweeted a lot, in turn helping those who stayed at home and couldn't come to cause stay up on what was going on.\n* Receptions rocked! The Sun reception was the best, but they were all good.\n* Delivering web services BOF. There were only a few people in the room, but it was great conversation. I really got a lot out of it, and some of you guys (you know who you are) are going to be getting emails from me about your deployment and such :)\n* Hotel was pretty good. I'm definitely not sold on the beds, but the facility was pretty nice and the staff was courteous.\n* Greensboro was better than I thought it was. I have lived in NC my whole life and never been to downtown Greensboro. It was bigger and more active than I thought it would be.\n* SWAG was in full attendance. I got all kinds of cool stuff including a football, USB hub, 20+ pens, a penguin (or duck, or platypus, or something), a glowy ball thingy, and some other things. Good job vendors!\n* Attendance was good! It seemed most sessions were full, at least the ones I was in.\n* I left the conference feeling hopeful about the direction of NCSU. That was a first for me relating to UNC Cause. I feel like we weren't surprised by anything, and we have good leadership in place to take us to where we need to go. Some events at the conference reassured me that we are moving, and for the first time in a long while (IMHO), in the right direction. Way to represent, NCSU!\n\n<b>The Not So Good</b>\n\n* Communication wasn't great. I think the lack of a central site with updates and whatnot caused some confusion as far as where stuff was, when it was, etc. I'd like to see a larger effort placed on communicating to attendees during the conference.\n* Twittering at the conference. I know, I put this in the \"good\" list too, but it belongs here as well. Our small groups efforts were good, but I suppose it was too little too late. I'm not sure some people really see the benefit of tweeting, but those of us that do can really not figure out how to function without it :) I'd like to see a bigger emphasis put on staying connected while at the conference.\n* False advertising of sessions. I'm not going to harp on this much, as it is not something the conference can really control, but a few sessions I (and others) went to weren't as advertised. If you are gonna talk about Banner, say you are gonna talk about Banner. You are going to either a) get people in your session who don't care about what you are talking about or b) miss out on people who might want to hear what you have to say. Either way, it is lose-lose. OK, off my soap box :)\n* Pepsi instead of Coke. Personal opinion only :)\n* No power strips. In a session where 20 people have laptops and there is only one electrical outlet, riots may ensue. It would be a worthwhile investment to put power strips in all the rooms.\n\nOverall, I'd say the conference was pretty good. The best thing about conferences are always the people, and this one is certainly no exception. Good job overall by the conference planning group for getting the vendors, the hotel, the food, etc.\n\nWe'll be back next year, so I hope to see you all in New Bern for UNC Cause 2009!","createdDate":"2008-11-20T14:50:21.000Z","updatedDate":"2014-08-01T18:41:03.863Z","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2008-11-20T14:30:00.000Z","publishWhen":"later"},{"id":"2486881:BlogPost:773","contributorName":"3h8vedhr1e7gr","title":"UNC CAUSE 08 (ad nauseum)","description":"I realize that both Jason and Nick have written about CAUSE already and I won't repeat them. A few highlights from my perspective that haven't already been mentioned:\n\n- <b>Adobe</b> -- I talked to the Adobe rep and we should soon be able to announce a demo (or a few) for NCSU. Their session was otherwise un-eventful and marked by technical difficulties (with the equipment not the applications)\n- <b>Addressing p2p</b> -- I've been working on this issue off and on at NC State for a couple years now but it's been more off than on lately. Apparently it's getting harder and harder for people to justify open networks on campuses and thanks to litigation it's looking like it's only a matter of time before some university ends up in court defending their due diligence. On an interesting side note, I also learned that our new CIO came from a campus where they turned off all p2p.\n- <b>Use the Power of the Web to Organize</b> -- This was one of my favorite sessions. The guy was a great speaker and had some fantastic ideas for organizing his life and time without spending all his time organizing his life and time. I came back and immediately dropped Google notebook into my Firefox and I'm considering testing the Add-On for 'Remember the Milk' that plays with Thunderbird's Lightning (currently in Alpha). And I have to buy an iPhone.\n- <b>Training and Education BOF</b> -- This was the session that Twanda Baker and I hosted and I was pretty disappointed. First of all, the turnout was lack-luster (bad session time) and the news was grim. Of the five schools represented, all had lost training staff recently. Interestingly, at least three of those schools had undergone re-orgs in the last year or so and that seemed to have contributed some... There also seemed to be a need for a much wider range of classes - which would be a great thing if only we had trainers and time to develop documentation. In the tradition of this fair site I created a Ning instance for trainers across the UNC system (I copy all Jason's good ideas). So if you're a trainer, please check it out: <a href=\"http://nctechtrainers.ning.com/\">http://nctechtrainers.ning.com/</a>\n- Google Lunch on Day Three -- I love Google and I love just about everything they're doing, and most of all, I like where their heads at. They're really looking at providing apps for everyone, no install needed, no proprietary crap; just all technology, all the time. Is it really that bad that they're going to take over the world?\n\nI went to other sessions as well. Let me know if you'd like to hear about any of these:\nWhy the Functional Users are Confused (UNC-GA)\nBrief Online Training: JIT (UNC-CH)\nSupport, Rollout of a CMS (ECU)\nGoogle Tools in the Classroom (NCSU)\nMac BOF\n\nAs you've heard, next year is in New Bern and it will be hosted by NC State. It's on us now people.","createdDate":"2008-11-20T14:25:18.000Z","updatedDate":"2014-08-01T20:45:27.057Z","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2008-11-20T14:25:18.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"2486881:BlogPost:769","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","title":"UNC Cause 2008 Day 3","description":"Day 3, here we come!\n\nBreakfast was good. There was OJ and biscuits this morning. There was also a raffle, but our group didn't win anything.\n\n<b>Digital Signage with Billboard</b>\n\nWe had a vested interest in this session. Andrew Stein from ECE presented about how they have taken our Billboard product and added a few features to satisfy their needs. Lots of good discussion about the reasons for digital signs and how Billboard will help. There were some requests for download links for Billboard, so if you want to download it, <a href=\"http://webapps.ncsu.edu/lifecycle/public/downloads/billboard-2.1.1.zip\">you can do that here</a>.\n\n<b>IPTV</b>\n\nAgain a few NCSU gave a good presentation. I am really interested in IPTV, so it was interesting to see how people on our campus are trying to solve the next generation television delivery issues. The current pilot only has about 10 channels, but they are investigating upping that to 20+. I gotta figure out how to get on this pilot. Looks like we (NCSU) are doing some cool things.\n\n<b>Project Management Across Enterprise</b>\n\nThe State of NC gave a presentation about project management across different agencies within the state. I'm not sure if they did much innovative, but it seemed like their focus was on \"collaboration through a tool\" rather than \"collaboration through people\". They wrote a project management app, then the legislature mandated that people use it, so it kinda had the \"we're gonna make you collaborate whether you want to or not\" feel. Iron fist of state government FTW!\n\n<b>Cloud Computing with Google</b>\n\nGoogle rocks my face. Seriously. The awesome things they do continually impress me, however they don't really surprise me. What I mean is that I have come to expect Google to kick butt at web applications, kinda like I expect Apple to kick butt at mobile devices.\n\nThe speaker was the world director of education sales. He talked about the way students communicate and think now as opposed to 5 years ago. His focus was on how Google is more nimble to adapt to changes because of their delivery method. I tend to agree, but you are also at the mercy of them.\n\nFor the talk, we had a twitter meet up and got to meet some of the folks we have been tweeting with face to face. The discussion came up after the presentation about why we hate Microsoft, but not Google. The argument was made that they both are take-over-the-world type companies, but we all love Google and hate Microsoft. I think it comes down to how Microsoft has been run and part of it does come from their delivery methodology. It takes MS months to get patches and updates out, it seems to take Google hours. Old and busted vs. new hotness. MS is computing of yesterday, Google is computing of tomorrow. At least that is my opinion.\n\nEither way, Google rocked. They have cool products, and I can't wait until we can investigate them some more for our campus.\n\nUNC Cause wrap up coming later....","createdDate":"2008-11-20T14:13:55.000Z","updatedDate":"2014-08-12T01:50:54.977Z","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2008-11-20T14:13:55.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"2486881:BlogPost:761","contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","title":"UNCCause08 at UNCG Wrapup","description":"So I'm back from my first UNC Cause, and overall it was definitely a productive and useful couple of days.\n\nThe sessions i attended ranged from things specifically targeted to my job as a web developer, to issues of student email (which i am on a committee for), to things that had nothing to do with my day-to-day job at all. The complete list of sessions is <a href=\"http://www.uncg.edu/cause08/\">available here</a>, but the ones that i attended were:\n\nAdobe\nNovell Teaming +\nNetApp Virtual Environments\nShibboleth BOF\nHow to Use the Latest Phone Technology (UNC Chapel Hill)\nAdventures in New Student Email (UNCP)\nWeb Services BOF)\nAfter the Project - \"You Only Thought You Were Done\" (NCSU Outreach Technology)\nUse the Power of the Web to Organize Your Life (UNC Chapel Hill)\nDigital Signage (NCSU)\nProject Collaboration (ITS)\nGoogle Apps (Closing Presentation)\n\nAlthough there were no real 'stand up and take notice' highlights for me personally, i was very interested in the work being done by UNCC and ECU regarding hosted web services (cPanel and surrounding issues). We met during the Web Services BOF and chatted for about an hour about several issues that are being seen on our campuses, and how we expect to tackle them in future (or how they are already being addressed on other campuses). They are rolling out a cPanel-esque solution, and im sure we'll stay in close contact with them to see how successful a venture it becomes.\n\nThe Novell Teaming + presentation was interesting, however i kept wondering how much i could trust a product that looked great in the demonstration, but was made by the same people who made GroupWise. I wonder if the problems I'm having with the \"features\" of groupwise are prevalent in their other products, or if they've truly made attempts to move past their own entrenched ways of doing things. (I only mention in parentheses that it crashed once during the presentation).\n\nUNCP's adventures in student email highlighted some of the pitfalls with outsourcing to anyone, let alone the problems that specifically had with Microsoft's Exchange Labs solution. I spoke to the presenter afterward and assured him that the problems that he found to be intermittent or random, were actually flaws in either the technology itself, or the procedure Microsoft has you adhere to. I ran into all of the issues UNCP did, when I rolled out the Live@EDU (Hotmail) solution as Director of IT at Lees-McRae College.\n\nI was repeatedly impressed by our own staff's initiatives, and how the group i am most often with (Jen, Jason, Garrison and I) were not really caught off-guard by anything happening on other campuses. I can't remember a time when there was an issue or project that we haven't already started, or at least haven't already considered as something we'll have to combat fairly soon. In that sense, i am very optimistic about the foresight and technical ability of the people i work with. Considering i've only been here at NCSU 3.5 months, its nice to know there's a high level of understanding and strategic operations/implementation ability in my circle of colleagues.\n\nSo, all in all, it was a good first conference for me. I look forward to the next one, when our current \"future\" plans, may be sessions that we present next year.","createdDate":"2008-11-20T13:44:50.000Z","updatedDate":"2014-10-14T18:47:23.648Z","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2008-11-20T13:44:49.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"2486881:BlogPost:723","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","title":"UNC Cause 2008 Day Two","description":"Day 2 recap! Here we go....\n\n<b>Breakfast</b>\n\nOverall, pretty good. One complaint is that there was no juice, just water and coffee.\n\n<b>UNCW Text Message Applications</b>\n\nUNCW is doing some interesting things with texting, although not really revolutionary. Similar to what was done in the last election, they have setup a code that students can use to get information about campus happenings (2 way automated texting, rather than one way only). They have developed some apps that seem to help students get associated with campus (trivia, events, etc). I learned some stuff about the SMS system in general, so it was worth it.\n\n<b>Using the Latest Phone Technologies</b>\n\nIn my mind, I automatically inserted the word \"cell\" before phone. That was my mistake because this was about as far from that kind of a topic as you could get. It was a talk given by the UNC help desk people on their processes and their new ACD system by Angel.com. I'm not really familiar with it at all, so I can't say much more than that. They do answer a donkey load of phone calls though. On average, one every six minutes. That's 24/7/365.\n\n<b>Institutional Repositories</b>\n\nThis presentation wasn't exactly what I expected. I was thinking having repositories for universities to share data and how those worked, and that was kinda what it was, but not really to the level of interest I cared about. UNCG's library people rolled their own solution to share documents from themselves and from other sister universities. They came to market with their product really quickly, and it seems like they are still working through some bugs and lack of features. They aren't really using any industry standards for content repositories or anything like that though. They claim that rolling their own instead of adopting an OS solution was cheaper, but I would doubt that they would be able to know all those costs yet, as maintenance for a homegrown piece of software always becomes more tedious than originally thought.\n\n<b>After the Project Project Management</b>\n\nHey, this is us! We presented on our policies and how we came about them. Standing room only in our session, so turnout was awesome. Heard some good comments, met some cool people. <a href=\"http://webapps.ncsu.edu/ot/2008/11/18/after-the-project-project-management-slides/\">You can download our slides here</a>.\n\n<b>Delivering Web Services BOF</b>\n\nHey, it's us again! Back to back sessions had my voice scratchy, but we had some good discussion in our BOF. UNCC and ECU are all dealing with the same kind of issues regarding web services, but I think they are farther along than we are. We only had a few people there, but we had some spirited discussion. Notes from this BOF to come later.\n\n<b>Use the Power of the Web to Organize Your Life and Get Things Done</b>\n\nJeff VanDrimmelen gave a really good talk about how to use resources on the web to stay organized and focused. He pretty much went totally Google. Mail, Calendar, and Notebook for his todo list. His method seemed to work well for him, but he focused on the idea that you should find your own way, then find the tools to help you. He had done LOTS of research before choosing Google to run his life, so it was helpful if someone was trying to do the same thing.\n\nI think organizational tools are similar to the properties behind project management. PM should not get in the way, it should help you along the way. Organizational tools are the same way. There is a fine line between \"helpful\" and \"tedious\".\n\n<b>Collaborating on IT Communication</b>\n\nThis BOF was about how we, as IT professionals on campuses, communicate with our users. I am pretty proud to say that NCSU seemed a good ways ahead of a lot of folks when it comes to communication (much to my surprise). Our folks (John, Jude, Stan, Everette, Me (Jason), etc.) really contributed to the BOF and had some hopefully good advice. We talked about our Ning rollout and OIT People. It was a good BOF, but I didn't really bring a lot away from it, except that we communicate better than I thought we did (comparatively speaking).\n\n<b>Sun Microsystems Reception</b>\n\nSun put on a nice little reception. Good food, good drinks. The NC A&amp;T Jazz Band played and they are good stuff. The conversation got a lot better when the drinks started flowing.\n\nOne of the more refreshing moments of the night was when our new CIO, Marc Hoit, sat down at our table and asked \"Alright, tell me what I am doing wrong\". I have NEVER had anybody at that level ask somebody at my level what he was doing wrong. It was very refreshing to hear our new leader getting feedback from those of us in the trenches. Our conversations went around Groupwise, web services delivery, iPhone integration, etc. The group started out kinda small (me, Garrison, Nick, Jen, John, Brandon and Bill) and the conversation was pretty good then. As more people started coming over, individual voices got lost a bit, but it was still cool that the CIO was hanging out and having a drink with us.\n\nAfter the reception, we all (Dr. Hoit included) went back to the bar from last night and played pool. I (Jason) am really horrible at pool (\"I got 3 in!\"), but it was a good time. Nick and Brandon schooled some locals at the pool table. Good stuff all around. I give Dr. Hoit lots of credit for hanging with us.\n\nDay 2....out!","createdDate":"2008-11-19T13:33:04.000Z","updatedDate":"2014-09-12T20:10:53.629Z","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2008-11-19T13:33:04.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"2486881:BlogPost:693","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","title":"UNC Cause 2008 Day One","description":"Our entire group is at UNC Cause this year. For those not in-the-know, Cause is a conference for the UNC University system IT people. We will be blogging our sessions, so here goes our recap of day one.\n\n<b>Vendor Fair</b>\n\nI was really surprised at the turnout for the vendor fair. I figured with the economy the way it is, and the common knowledge that the UNC system is going through major budget cuts, that the vendor fair would be sparse. It was actually bigger than the vendor fair at ZendCon 2008, with MUCH better swag. Pen's must have been on special somewhere, cause everyone had some. AT&amp;T had an awesome glowing ball. And there were sweet football dart things.\n\nBest thing from the vendor fair was the discovery of a company (Notify Technology) that will let me sync my iPhone with my Groupwise calendar. Don't know if any of our email and calendaring people see our blog or not, but if you do, you guys should get all up on that. We need that if we are going to have to keep using Groupwise.\n\n<b>Novell Training and Collaboration Social Networking Deal</b>\n\nOK, disclaimer time. Garrison and I are not big fans of Novell, specifically GroupWise. Mostly because their extreme lack of a decent Mac client. That is another post for another blog, but anyway... We went into this session with a bias against Novell, so take this session for what it's worth.\n\nNovell has come up with a swiss army knife-type application that does a whole lot of social networking-esque activities targeted at better project management. Their app seems pretty neat, but it seems to (very reluctantly) tightly integrate with all their other products, including GroupWise. One thing I heard which I have hope that they actually integrate is the adoption of standards, including iCal and mailing protocols.\n\nSome of the stuff you can do in there seemed cool. They showed off a versioning feature using Webdav, which I knew about, just have never really seen in action. That was cool stuff.\n\nOh yeah, GroupWise/Training thing crashed during the demo! There were several chuckles from the NCSU folks in the audience.\n\nOverall, the product seemed OK I guess. Not gonna sign up to use it right now though.\n\n<b>NetApp</b>\n\nI've heard of NetApp, as they have a place in RTP, but I'd never really seen how they do what they do. They're proprietary RAID solution along with their ability to instantly restore is pretty fantastic. They have a 50% guarantee too - They guarantee that you'll use 50% less storage or you get the rest of your required capacity for free. I don't know how much their stuff costs, but it looks like it would definitely save money. Since we don't have anything to do with purchasing storage hardware, I can really say more than that. But if I ever need lots of storage that's backed up and redundant, I'll definitely give NetApp a look-see.\n<b>\nShibboleth BOF</b>\n\nMost worthwhile session of the day. Shibboleth is an authentication/authorization system that the UNC system is migrating to. There was no real format to the session, but I have some opinions on our adaptation of Shib.\n\nI wasn't exactly familiar with the intricacies of Shib. Apparently, it is new. And I mean really new (like a real version of it was just implemented in the real world about 6 months ago). With new technology comes problems that people didn't exactly work out in the beginning. Unfortunately, people are just now figuring out those problems. It is this reason that I question our (UNC Systems) reason for moving toward this system so young in its life cycle.\n\nFunctional things like single logout haven't really been figured out yet. That seems to be a problem. And I was a little uncomfortable with the word \"hack\" and how much it was thrown around in the BOF. As a programmer, I hate that word. And I hate it even more when it is used as a solution.\n\nDon't get me wrong. The idea of Shibboleth is great. Single sign-on for all the UNC systems so anyone can use anyone elses stuff. Great idea! However, I think we may wanna put the brakes on a little until the group behind Shibboleth (i2 ?) works out the kinks. Not that my opinion will count for much, but that is just the impression I got.\n\n<b>Trivia</b>\n\nWe came in first place! BUT lost a tiebreaker. So instead of getting $25 gift cards, we got shirts. Fun evening. Thanks to Jen and Harry for doing the trivia, even if my bribes of drink tickets didn't get us to win :-)\n\n<b>Novell Reception</b>\n\nNovell sponsored a reception at a local micro brewery, Natty Greene's. It was pretty crowded, and a real good time. We played pool, had some good beer, and good times with co-workers. The best part about Cause is the people, and they didn't dissappoint (and that's all I have to say about that).","createdDate":"2008-11-18T14:01:08.000Z","updatedDate":"2014-08-16T02:15:17.640Z","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2008-11-18T14:01:08.000Z","publishWhen":"now"},{"id":"2486881:BlogPost:661","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","title":"Blogging while at UNC Cause 08","description":"Just wanted to post a quick note to suggest that everyone who is attending UNC Cause this year to blog about the sessions they attend.

It is my understanding that this bar will be expected to be deployed to any webpage on served by a *.ncsu.edu address. As developers, it will probably fall to us to deploy this bar in our themes and such to comply with the plan.\n\nFor a draft example of what I'm talking about, look at <a href=\"http://www.ncsu.edu\">www.ncsu.edu</a> specifically at the red and white link bar across the top of the page. They are working on plans to allow color scheme changes and the like, so the bar doesn't have to clash with existing designs.","createdDate":"2008-11-13T16:19:01.000Z","updatedDate":"2014-09-18T13:28:17.655Z","publishStatus":"publish","publishTime":"2008-11-13T16:19:01.000Z","publishWhen":"now","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:524","contributorName":"1emnywagsa7hr","description":"Thank you for posting this.
