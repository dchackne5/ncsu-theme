It's not what's happened to<br/>Postini, but usually it's \"What's happened to my direct mailings?!\".</p>\n<p>Postini operates by means to heuristics; an experience-based technique<br/> for solving problems that are not exhaustive searches but methods which<br/> try to speed up the process and hopefully find a satisfactory solution.<br/>What does that mean? Well, in layman's terms it means Postini guess.</p>\n<p>Now Postini makes guesses based off many factors:</p>\n<p>- the spamish-ness of the message (key words, content of the message,<br/>links within the message, etc)</p>\n<p>Always try the message to yourself first. See what the spam score is<br/>in the header by using the Postini header analyzer:</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.google.com/postini/headeranalyzer/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.google.com/postini/headeranalyzer/</a></p>\n<p>Make sure you aren't using words like \"password\" and \"userid\", those are in\u00a0</p>\n<p>most phishing email.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- but most people don't know that it also makes decisions based on</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0o the IP reputation of the sender<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0o how fast you are sending the messages<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0o how many bounces you have in your subscriber base<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0o the reputation of your sending address</p>\n<p>I'll go into each of these below:<br/> o IP Reputation<br/> ---------------<br/> Every time someone clicks the \"report this as spam\" button, entries go<br/> back to postmasters. These postmasters collect this data and submit<br/> IP addresses into lists such as SBL (Spamhaus block lists), ROXUS, njabl,<br/> blockade, etc. These are lists that NCSU doesn't control (though we do<br/> submit bad hosts that are complained about to them.) These lists are<br/> munged by Postini services in their proprietary way to produce changes to<br/>the heuristics for IP addresses.</p>\n<p>You can see your ip reputation on many online services:<br/><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.commtouch.com/check-ip-reputation\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.commtouch.com/check-ip-reputation</a></p>\n<p>o How fast you send<br/> -------------------<br/> Postini looks closely for spammer activity. Spammers want to get in, push<br/> their load, and then leave. Does your activity look like a spammer?<br/> If you try to mass send as fast as you can messages, it could be the case<br/> that Postini sees the start of your message stream and thinks \"this is the<br/> same message going to a lot of people. I will up the spamishness score on<br/> these messages because it looks like a lot of similar messages going to a<br/>lot of different people.</p>\n<p>So while your message started out as a nice email to your subscribers,<br/> somewhere in the middle Postini started marking it as spam and putting it<br/>in your quarantine.</p>\n<p>o The # of bounces in your subscriber base<br/> ------------------------------------------<br/> Postini looks at bad addresses/bounces because again that's the same as a<br/> spammer's profile. They have a mass of addresses and they want to try<br/> each and every one because a spammer's goal is to send their message to as<br/> many people in as short a time as possible; so each address to them is<br/>a potential sale.</p>\n<p>When Postini sees the bounces, it believes you are a spammer since no one<br/> but a spammer would send to addresses that bounce or are inactive. This is<br/> the number one reason why messages get blocked. You have a subscriber<br/> list that has a lot of bad addresses on it and Postini will stop your<br/>message after as few as 10 bounces of addresses that it knows are bad.</p>\n<p>o Lastly, the reputation of your address<br/> ----------------------------------------<br/>\u00a0Is your address being reported as a spammer? That can happen as people report your message as spam.<br/>You can get around this by:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Having people opt into your mailings<br/>\u00a0- Have people add your to their approve senders list.</p>","createdDate":"2012-03-26T16:59:22.503Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:30894","contributorName":"1emnywagsa7hr","description":"<p>OK, do we have a Majordomo Web API?</p>","createdDate":"2012-03-26T14:31:40.978Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:30892","contributorName":"1emnywagsa7hr","description":"<p>I should add that my office is also currently looking for a solution to replace a number of existing listservs with an updated tool.

You should also note that this is a static list of flat files and there's no magical identification going on behind the scenes to serve you personalized content, which is what initially comes to mind when you see 'MySomething'. Disappointing to the user? Sure.</p>\n<p><br/>Shortly after we launched the site with this new 'MyMAE' area, there was a lot of confusion. People were writing in and saying they couldn't find any of the forms that were on the site previously, so to eliminate confusion and make the location of the forms more clear to users, I added another link (directly beside MyMAE) for 'Forms', the link pointed to the exact same page that MyMAE did, but it was surprising how many folks clicked one versus the other.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a target=\"_self\" href=\"discussions/11-mymaevsforms.gif\"><img class=\"align-full\" src=\"discussions/12-mymaevsforms.gif\" width=\"483\"/></a></p>\n<p>While the trend above shows that 'MyMAE' consistently received more clicks than 'Forms',\u00a0 I have to believe that many of the clicks for 'MyMAE' were simply done out of curiosity.

I then close the toolbar, which reloads the page, prompting me again to choose a location to save a file.","createdDate":"2010-10-19T13:12:37.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:12627","contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","description":"I can look into this and see if there's a good solution.\n\nIt got me thinking though....what's the reason you want to close the toolbar without refreshing the target page?

If i have the toolbar in a div that gets hidden (without then refreshing the page) the golink would remain in the address bar, but there would be no way to find the actual URL you had subsequently surfed to inside the browser. The premise, is that as long as the golink is displayed in the address bar, there needs to be the links to report abuse, or to contact the owner. When the golink url is gone, then there is no need for the toolbar, which is why the \"close\" button reloads the page completely.\n\nIf you (or anyone else) has ideas about how to implement that request without affecting the intended use of golinks, I'd like to hear it.\n\nI'm not sure, given the way golinks is designed to work, that I could make that happen in the way you want it to.

The first is an easy-to-use RSS widget based on <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxfeeds/\">Google AJAX Feed API</a>. The second is an html 5 aria template system that uses most of the NC State core styles and typography.</p>\n<h3>RSS Widget</h3>\n<p>Lets you embed RSS feeds anywhere on a web page.

Configuration page simply supplies the needed html code for easy implementation.</p>\n<h3>HTML5 Template</h3>\nThe purpose of the template is to offer a solid foundation for custom on-brand website design. Web Communications has started using this \"framework\" for new websites, including the chancellor installation site. The code base should give developers a good starting point for most projects, offering an alternative to the NC State template.<br/>\n<p>Template system includes three possible configurations: three-column, two-column and two-column-with-horizontal-navigation (with an optional superfish jQuery plugin). The template uses 75% of NCSU.EDU font style. Developers can bypass template styles by using a local stylesheet.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://framework.webcommdev.com/\">three-column</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://framework.webcommdev.com/2-col-vert.php\">two-column</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://framework.webcommdev.com/2-col-horiz.php\">two-column-with-horizontal-navigation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Current features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>html 5, should work on all modern browsers and IE6</li>\n<li>Photoshop starter file</li>\n<li>customizable header background and font colors <br/><ul>\n<li>re-configure branding/utility strip color combos</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Non-image banner</li>\n<li>new right column bright styles</li>\n<li>wordpress style captioned images</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Planned features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>wordrpess theme</li>\n<li>image gallery, similar to <a href=\"http://www.ncsu.edu/about-nc-state/chancellor/gallery/\">chancellor's office</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ncsu.edu/about-nc-state/campus-tour/2010/09/hillsborough-st-retrospective.php\">Hillsborough Street Retrospective</a>.</li>\n<li>optional shadowbox (lightbox) code</li>\n<li>Story/Feature player (jQuery UI Tabs) similar to ncsu.edu</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The template is php-based, using a configuration file and a series of include files.

When I load the page and start tabbing I see the entire branding bar outlined, then a vertical dotted line right after NC State University brick. If I immediately hit tab again there is no response but if I wait ~5 seconds before tabbing then I see Campus Directory outlined. For this 5 seconds something is eating keystrokes. Continuing to press tab without waiting for the \"timeout\" never gets the focus to move. IE 8 doesn't do this. I haven't tried Opera or Chrome.\n\nOnce I wait the 5 seconds I can tab and I see Libraries, MyPack Portal, Campus Map and Search NCSU.EDU each in turn receive focus and and become outlined. After that nothing is seen to receive focus on the screen -- nothing is outlined in the site navigation bar as it is tabbed through until you apparently get to Industry Info when the drop down opens up. Tabbing though that shows the links to be underlined. You need to have something like a:hover, a:focus { text-decoration: underline; } for the menu items. It's not accessible without this visual indication of focus. Your side links for Facebook and Twitter lose their underline when hovered over but have no visual indication of focus via tabbing either. Neither do the links at the bottom of the page.\n\nDisabling javascript stills allows the Industry Info drop down to show with the mouse but it is completely lost with the keyboard. Tabbing through the document with javascript disabled never causes the drop down to show.

I am not knowledgeable about everything that the www4 space can do, but from what some people have said, Google sites is not have complete feature parity.\n\nHaving said that, I am a believer that Google Sites can and even should take the place of a lot of what www4 serves up now, just so we can take advantage of more of the benefits of outsourcing (bandwidth, maintenance, revision history, sharing etc).\n\nRight now, our policy regarding Google sites is the same as the policy for web content at NCSU, with the exception that if you have a Google Apps account, you can self-provision a site. Site owners are still governed by the existing acceptable use policies and all that lovely legal language.\n\nNaming conventions become difficult, because we currently don't have a way to proactively reserve or restrict the names (and therefore URLs) for sites. So...the presiding wisdom in cases of misuse, or a when site named \"sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/chancellor\" contains objectionable material, or material that has nothing to do with the chancellor, we (OIT/ the service owner) reserve the right to remove or replace that the site.\n\nIn future, we hope to develop or take advantage of tools that will allow us to monitor these sites, while still allowing the self-service features that make it such an attractive service.\n\nLike any service, it will not fit the needs of every single audience, but it will meet a lot of them. So....i think that we can and should move more content to Google Sites, and in the process cut down on the burden we place on our internal infrastructure.\n\nI'll be happy to answer any and all Google-related questions...but i might need some time to get back to you on some topics :-) ..... even if the answer is \"we don't know yet.\"","createdDate":"2010-08-19T18:17:33.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:12388","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","description":"You mean the google committee?

It's just what I'd like to see.\n\nTo me, it's the perfect opportunity to get rid of www4 space both for faculty/staff and for students. The biggest argument I have heard to keep www4 space is for easy URL access to a file. I know some people still use it for posting personal websites as well. However, Google Docs now lets you upload any file type you want and share it easily. And web hosting is so cheap now and full of features, www4 doesn't make sense to host a website.\n\nIf we were able to move that direction, I think to try to do too much governing with it would be a mistake. I'd think that URL's would be handled like www4 ones are now where it would be something like <a href=\"http://sites.ncsu.edu/jfaustin/\" target=\"_blank\">http://sites.ncsu.edu/jfaustin/</a>.\n\nBasically, I feel like Google Sites is the perfect opportunity to replace www4 with a better, cheaper (free), outsourced service, while still providing everyone with an account the ability to quickly put up a web page.\n\nJust my $0.02.","createdDate":"2010-08-11T18:17:48.000Z"}]},{"id":"2486881:Topic:12282","contributorName":"bethanyvsmith","title":"Wibiya Toolbar","description":"I received a \"request\" to look at the Wibiya Toolbar <a href=\"http://www.wibiya.com/\">http://www.wibiya.com/</a> based on its use on the Admissions site <a href=\"http://admissions.ncsu.edu/why-ncstate/visit/\">http://admissions.ncsu.edu/why-ncstate/visit/</a>\u00a0 Has anyone used this?

Here is the lowdown:\n\nThe data that is stored about a semester is somewhat more dynamic than I had originally thought. Apparently, many of the dates change quite often, including the official beginning and ending of a semester. There is a fear among the data stewards about putting information out there as \"official\" until they are confirmed, so there will be a limit on how far in the future semester data can be delivered.\n\nAlso, there are several different semester calendars that are stored in Oracle based on who they effect. Grad students, Undergrads, Ag Institute, Vet Med and Non-degree seeking students all have different calendars. The API which we create is going to need to be able to handle any of those options to return data.\n\nThere are quite a few more dates in the system than just semester start and end dates. These are the dates we can get:\n\nFirst Day Of Classes\nLast day of classes\nLast day for Wait list\ndrop deadline\nLast date to cancel\nlast date to withdraw (no penalty)\nLast date to withdraw (penalty)\nFull graded date (when we look at status and suspend students)\ngraduation application dates\n\nDave is looking into exam dates as well, which would be great to include. My thought is to be able to provide all of these dates through an API for each semester.\n\nWhile going into the future to look for semester data is iffy, looking into the past will not be so bad. We will have access to lots of historic data.\n\nDave is working on setting up the access we need in Oracle, so we are going to start setting up some infrastructure here to be able to support an API.","createdDate":"2010-08-11T17:19:37.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:12019","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"For wolfware.ncsu.edu \"current\" right now is the combination of 2106 (Summer I and Summer 10 Week) and 2107 (Summer II) and will remain that way until the fall semester.\n\nFor another one of our apps, \"current\" right now is 2106, 2107, and 2108 because it deals with courses and registrations.\n\nHowever, the real multiple semesters problem hasn't really been solved, because most of our stuff just needs \"Summer\". My plan to solve it is to always return an array of semesters which contain active courses. Something like this: SELECT DISTINCT STRM, SESSION_CODE FROM PS_NC_DNRM_SCHE_VW WHERE START_DT &lt;= '2010-07-22' AND END_DT &gt;= '2010-07-22' However, I am under the impression that SIS uses another table with only the default semester dates so it should be faster (but which would not take into account modified course dates). Mainly I want to make sure that I don't lock students out of their courses too early or leave the courses open too long, so precision is important.\n\nThe unique key for a semester is the combination of STRM and SESSION_CODE. The unique key for a class section is STRM and CLASS_NBR (there is another unique combination of around six fields, but I prefer to join on two columns instead of six). It is a given that Summer Ten Week will be current at the same time as Summer II. STRM is a 4 digit number such that 2101 = 2010 Spring. Rather than splice a 0 into the second character position, I believe that it is cleaner to set the epoch at 1800 (as it predates the university and 210 + 1800 = 2010). The problem being that the year 2100's Spring semester will likely be represented as 3001 (though we're likely to switch systems long before then, but the epoch addition seems to be more legible and would continue to work if we keep that representation).\n\n...hmm, think I got carried away again.

I have a feeling that this API draft doesn't take into account the special situations that occur during the summer. 2106 started 2010-05-24 and will typically end on 2010-06-25. 2107 starts on 2010-07-01 and will typically end on 2010-08-04. However, that noticeably doesn't include 2106 10W (the other two are both 5W), which typically goes from 2010-05-24 to 2010-08-04. Of course, there are 70 cases where 10W extends until 2010-08-09, meaning that 2106 ends after 2107 and exists simultaneously with 2107 for its duration. Please note that I have excluded the exceptions to these generalities (date ranges which did not have more than 11 entries). How we handle this case is rather important, but it may make sense to be particularly clear about what we are asking, because if I am trying to ask the question \"What is the current semester?\", I should probably get the same result as the question \"What semesters have ongoing courses?\". Of course, we need to also be able to use this to be able to answer the question sequence: \"What semesters have ongoing courses?\", \"From those semesters, which courses am I taking?\". In theory, 2106 5W classes should not be returned after June 25th. In practice, we'll probably want to leave all summer classes active for the duration (in an attempt at providing a consistent experience). So then, do we say that 2107 is active for the full duration as well? It may depend on the situation. As such, it would be good to provide a decent chunk of information about the whole 5W 10W non-unique STRM datasets. Specifically, if we can specify STRM, we'll also have to specify the SESSION_CODE (at least for xxx6 STRMs).\n\nNot exactly a fan of the name \"getNoClasses\". As conflicting as it is, I'd prefer something like \"getClosures\". I would guess that there is an official name for that from the University Schedule, so it may make sense to use that.\n\nNot a fan of having the default semester \"object\" be so bloated, but I would like to be able to get the full blob in one pull by specifying the details via parameters.

Our current product list literally contains a list of 'products' (specific websites and webtools) that we manage. Before any help ticket can be closed, it must have a product assigned to it. However, we're now realizing that this approach isn't actually all that useful to us because it doesn't allow us to easily summarize the types of requests we are fielding.<br/><br/>For instance, if an end user writes to us asking for WRAP access to \"Internal Tool A\", we'll tag that call with the product name 'Internal Tool A'. We thought this approach was great because it would enable us to summarize our support efforts on a product by product basis at the end of the year. <br/><br/>However, there's a couple problems with that...<br/><br/>1) You might notice that some products have a larger call volume than others and immediately accuse them of being clunky or problematic. However, you then realize that not all support tickets are bug reports, some of them are for feature requests... so you'd be jumping to conclusions prematurely without first investigating the types of being calls attributed to that product<br/><br/>2) There's a good chance you have a product that has a larger user base than your other products, it's probably going to get more call tickets assigned to it simply because of that<br/><br/>.. I'm sure you can see the rest.<br/><br/>What we're proposing (internally) is that we re-structure this product list to more or less fit the 'types' of requests we get:<br/><br/><ul>\n<li>Request for WRAP Access</li>\n<li>Request for Database Access</li>\n<li>Environment Troubleshooting (Apache or PHP)</li>\n<li>Request for Server Write Access</li>\n<li>Content Management System Support</li>\n<li>Request for Sign-up / Registration System</li>\n<li>...</li>\n</ul>\n^ This new structure will hopefully show us (in our reports) exactly where we are spending most of our time and resources. Once that picture becomes clearer, we'll know where we should make improvements and invest in projects that will make us more efficient.<br/><br/>So a few quick questions...<br/><ol>\n<li>Does your group use Remedy?</li>\n<li>Do you use Remedy as both a project management tool and support ticket tracking system or just one of the two?\u00a0</li>\n<li>Do you use Remedy to create reports summarizing the work your group does?<br/></li>\n<li>What are the main types of web requests that your group deals with most frequently?</li>\n<li>Would it benefit us (as the university web developer community) to have a single web product list in Remedy that all groups would use?</li>\n</ol>\nSuggestions?

Because Remedy isn't really how we do project management, it would mostly be additional overhead to include our \"products\" which are mostly internal and rarely applicable to other units.","createdDate":"2010-05-14T14:04:02.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:11929","contributorName":"3p7bzgj31hmap","description":"1. Does your group use Remedy?\n\nYep, at CNR we do.\n\n2. Do you use Remedy as both a project management tool and support ticket tracking system or just one of the two?\n\nMostly just for a support tracking system although it is used informally for project tracking. I for example created a product for \"Web Dev Requests\" and will use that product for any kind of project-type task. There's also the Origin field which contains \"Project\" which I'll also use for anything that requires a bit more coordination and long-term effort. Again, fairly informal, but a way to differentiate the simpler requests from the more complex project-type tasks.\n\n3. Do you use Remedy to create reports summarizing the work your group does?\n\nWe do, our boss will run reports from time to time and I'll run reports for myself from time to time just to see where I'm at. Dan Green's group created a pretty nice and basic reporting Web tool a while back and I used to use that but it has been disabled. I think that's due to the fact that you can get reports from a new system run by OIT which I actually haven't played with yet.\n\n4. What are the main types of web requests that your group deals with most frequently?\n\nThe largest number of requests regard Adobe Contribute and permissions. We have 50+ Web editors (though only about 7 or so are very active) so it's pretty common that someone will request a key, or a re-activation of their key. These calls come in frequently but are very simple. There are many other common themes of requests, such as new site requests and the projects that surround bringing those up, righting display problems for older websites, upgrading existing sites with dynamic content and various sundry questions about working on the Web (URL, images, metadata, other best practice issues). This is a 10,000 ft view by the way, not exactly a formal analysis of calls.\n\n5. Would it benefit us (as the university web developer community) to have a single web product list in Remedy that all groups would use?\n\nAt CNR we define all products we use and like ITECS we force a product choice on the closing of a call. If you look at the Products field and browse to CNR you'll see what we've got, including a subcategory for Web. Keep in mind that if a product appears in our CNR category and somewhere else in the Remedy product tree it isn't duplicate products, they share the same ID, just show up in two different spots on the tree.\n\nMike you might want to bring these questions to the Remedy Advisory committee that's headed up by Larry Robinson at OIT. I do think there's value in having uniformity in the support metrics we all use. But I also think it's more important for individual shops to figure this out on their own. Definitely worth a discussion either way.","createdDate":"2010-05-14T13:11:21.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:11927","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","description":"1. Does your group use Remedy?\n\nSparingly. It didn't really jive with what we wanted to do.\n\n2. Do you use Remedy as both a project management tool and support ticket tracking system or just one of the two?\n\nOnly support stuff, and usually only when it comes from an external-to-OIT source.\n\n3. Do you use Remedy to create reports summarizing the work your group does?\n\nNo\n\n4. What are the main types of web requests that your group deals with most frequently?\n\nBug and feature requests. We really wanted a more granular and consistent way of handling these.\n\n5. Would it benefit us (as the university web developer community) to have a single web product list in Remedy that all groups would use?\n\nI think it would benefit us, as a community, to have a single list of web products anywhere. I started going down that road once, but didn't get very far. An integrated system where people could go to access these tools, download the source, see who the group is that created the tool, etc would be completely awesome.\n\n---\n\nWe have implemented Redmine as our choice for ticket tracking. It gave us a good bit of flexibility, integrated with SVN, had a wiki for documentation, and great tracking tools. It's lacking in reports, and it is a Ruby app so getting it going on campus was a bit of a pain, but it has worked well for us for the last year+.\n\nIt has some very loose project management aspects in it, but not nearly good enough. I know the libraries have used Basecamp and we have messed with it some. Since it is for-pay, that introduces some additional challenges, but if there is enough interest perhaps we could explore a community license for it or something.","createdDate":"2010-05-14T13:00:03.000Z"}]},{"id":"2486881:Topic:11924","contributorName":"11j9b5inrnbhl","title":"NCDEVCON Free and at NCSU May 22-23","description":"Looks like Shawn Dunning's crew has been busy moving and shaking in the web dev world.\u00a0 NCWEBDEV is sited at the College of Textiles nine days hence.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://ncdevcon.com/page.cfm/schedule\">http://ncdevcon.com/page.cfm/schedule</a><br/><br/>Hrm, maybe I can get a few sessions in before *and* after the Eos Reunion...<br/>","createdDate":"2010-05-13T14:07:34.000Z","updatedDate":"2010-05-14T14:18:07.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"Web Programming","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:11933","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"Note that the primary focus here is on Adobe products.

There's always a lot of discussion amongst campus communicators about \"Points of Pride\" and how we need them. From a central messaging standpoint, it would be a great way to provide a repository of key marketing messages available for various units on campus to pull from.\n\nI suppose there's a significant amount of improved control that comes with developing a single-purpose tool, but I wonder if a dedicated wordpress instance might be able to help with a bit of it. Offer out a variety of tagged/categorized fact feeds via RSS and a nifty little \"add this feed to my page\" tool (PHP and Javascript persuasion plus whatever anyone else wants to build) so the non-developer Web managers can plop it on their pages. Wordpress would allow for multiple user access to specific buckets of facts, so people could pull from other lists or create their own.\n\nDunno, just wondering if it'd work. Either way, very cool idea. Back in 2007 when I first started, one of the key homepage promo blocks was the \"By The Numbers\" block that displayed a random fact on the homepage. Wasn't as smart as the tool you're describing, but the concept was there. We later abandoned that so we could re purpose the space for, well, crisis communications early on, and now we've moved to what we call internally \"engagement\" promos.

Also, service availability and response rate would have to be excellent. As a stopgap for slow responses, allowing for a data dump (JSON?) would allow for local caching and randomization which would limit service traffic.

Your file lacks an XML encoding value in the declaration, which would take precedence over the META tag, but the content type header takes precedence over both, and the header is wrong. Here is the Firefox Web Developer dump of the headers your server provided:\n\nDate: Mon, 03 May 2010 21:03:32 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.2.14 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.14 OpenSSL/0.9.8e-fips-rhel5 DAV/2 PHP/5.3.2\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.2\nKeep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\n\n200 OK\n\nIdeally, the server should be serving XHTML files with a default of UTF-8, with a content type of \"application/xhtml+xml\" .\n\nBe warned that since you have been serving as HTML, your pages haven't been parsed as XML in the way that XHTML demands, so switching the content type will introduce draconian error checking of XML and will doubtlessly cause some pages to completely fail to display... unless you really are producing clean, well-formed XHTML.\n\nYou might take a stop-gap approach by using a .htaccess file to <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#forcetype\" target=\"_blank\">force a charset</a> of UTF-8 on the documents.","createdDate":"2010-05-03T21:32:09.000Z"}]},{"id":"2486881:Topic:11837","contributorName":"13bkpxt4h8ige","title":"\"upload file\" PHP code in AFS","description":"Need some help.

We have worked extremely hard, as an administrative group and the community as a whole, to build this site into a valuable and reliable resource for web developers and designers both on and off campus. We have almost 250 members and over a year and a half worth of content. That is a whole lot of stuff and people to move, and there is no guarantee that it will be transferable (although Ning will give us our data if we decide to leave...in what format, I don't know).\n\nI feel like if we move to another free service, we could only be prolonging the inevitable. Ning is moving to a pay model because it cannot sustain itself and the demand which it created. Other social networking sites like this have spun off from Ning and have proceeded to fail swiftly. I don't want to have to go through the work of moving all our users and our content now, then having to do it again when the next service goes under, or goes for-pay, or whatever. However, this is a risk that we took by going with a \"in-the-cloud\" service as opposed to standing up our own.\n\nSeveral folks have suggested installing our own service on campus, which <i>could</i> be done. However, I don't believe it <i>should</i> be done. Standing up a service ourselves is in no way, shape, or form free. There are costs for the web hosting, bandwidth, and maintenance that take time and resources that are already constrained. We, as the administrative team, just don't have time to do it and maintain it.\n\nSo, in my opinion, if Ning's pricing structure is reasonable, I say we stay. We can find the resources. Heck, I'm sure there are people on here (like Jay, and myself) who would be willing to shell out the dough from our own pockets if the University won't step up. However, I feel like OIT can probably secure the funding. If it can't we'll find someone else that can. Bottom line, this group is very valuable to the continuity of web design, development and communication for NC State. I believe many folks recognize that, and I hope they will come through for us.\n\nLet's see what Ning does first, but I honestly don't see us moving off of this service. I've already started the ball rolling up my management chain to get a budget for the web developers group for us to use to bring in speakers, run the Ning site, etc. We'll figure out a way to make this happen, one way or another.","createdDate":"2010-04-16T13:25:55.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:11732","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"Agreed.

If we pay for the service, then i think we can expect a higher level of service. While it was free, i could understand us having to do a little more manual processes to handle the spam. But if there's no assurance or proof that a paid account would solve these problems...then I'm out....and i say let's move somewhere else.\n\nI don't think moving to pure bulletin board configuration is the answer...like phpBB. Having managed several of these in the past, i dont feel like phpBB meets the needs of this community. Yes...it could serve as a place to foster discussion, but i think the other pieces like Events, the new Meetup Plugin, Blogs, and Video/Photo options are important too. If there are modules/plugins to make phpBB do all this, then i'm all for it. But from my experience, phpBB is more for basic discussions only.\n\nSo....after all that...i say we wait to find out the pricing model, and then revisit the discussion at that time. Being one of the few admins who manage the Ning website itself, it's of the utmost importance to me that whatever we stay on, or move to, is easy to maintain.\n\nWould it be helpful if we planned on discussing this in person at our next meetup?

I'd be more concerned about the intangible costs.\n\nUnless it is funded by donations, someone has to put the support cost into a budget item. I imagine that is getting harder to do these days. Even if funded by membership fees or corporate sponsorship, someone will still need to manage an account, whether in the form of a bank account or just a manila envelope and a ledger sheet. But funds are a lot easier to collect through an integrated payment system tied to a bank account set aside specifically for the site.\n\nNot so sure about groupsite.com.

Honestly, if you want to see margin of error, ask the same set of questions here and see how many people get it wrong.\n\nActually, that would probably make for a worthwhile result set: rather than just have 253 respondents (from 253 separate universities?), have multiple people from each school respond and make sure that an answer that isn't subjective has a majority before using the data.\n\nRealize of course that I don't think I'll get these correct, but that's the point. I'll be skipping the \"title\" question, because it's pointless, and the last two because they're entirely subjective.\n\n1. How large is your institution? He means how many students, which I will guess is around 34788\n2. What is the landscape of your web environment? Here he acts like centralized and decentralized are polar opposites. I'd say we're both.\n3. If centralized, how large is the full time staff? My guess is the centralized group would probably be OIT. Of course, it's hard to tell how much of the Org Chart would be counted for this metric. I would definitely include ISO, in addition to the usual suspects, but what is the qualifying test per person to determine inclusion as \"web environment full time staff\"?\n4. If centralized, how is priority determined? I believe Jason said they make their own decisions, but that's from an outside POV.\n5. Roughly how many full time staff institution wide work on all the web sites? a billion! Or I could just count the number of people on the ning (195) pretend they all work at NCSU and multiple by some arbitrary number (2.5) because market penetration is low. 487.5 people\n6. What is the state of a content management system (cms) at your institution? Decentralized by site/department (that's my guess at least)\n7. If you use a CMS, how was it adopted? The only CMS *I* currently use is Open Source, even though our main website was developed in house (it's not really a CMS).\n8. If your CMS was built elsewhere, what is the name/company of that CMS? The CMS website I mentioned is Wordpress.\n9. What department controls your institutions home page? OIT, I think? Or is it University Communications? I'm not really sure.\n10. Does your institution have a home page committee? Not that I know of. Do branding recommendations count?\n11. When was your last home page redesign? Mine or the institution? It was probably a couple years ago either way.\n12. How was your last home page redesign handled? In house I assume.\n13. What is the primary programming language that runs your institution\u2019s Web environment? Depends on who you ask. Probably PHP. We have a lot of ColdFusion though. Not sure if there's any ASP out there, but there's probably a bit of Perl and Java (I can think of at least one example of each).\n\nWell there you go.

Mail, Flickr, Google Reader, the list goes on and on.\n\nWouldn't it be nice if those things acted a little more like desktop applications and left your browser free for doing just that, browsing?\n\nEnter Fluid.\n\nFluid is an application that builds applications. Basically, it lets you create a site specific browser (SSB) with the url and icon you provide. This application can live in your applications folder just like any other application and has all the properties of any other desktop application.\n\nEvery Fluid app also has a javascript API that allows web applications to be able to do things like add badges to the dock icon or fire Growl notifications. This is especially useful for apps like Gmail where you want to see if you've got new messages without having to leave what you're doing.\n\nThere is built-in support for GreaseMonkey-compatible userscripting too, so you can still add things like dock badges to apps that don't have support built-in already. I've pasted my userscript for adding a dock badge for unread messages for Google Wave below if you're interested.\n\nDownload Fluid and free up your browser for browsing today!\n\nFluid_Google_Wave.user.js - Put this in your Google Wave userscripts folder and then reload your userscripts.

There's no harm in installing both plugins.\n\nDuring my various site optimization endeavors this year, I learned that the HTML 4 DTD allows you to omit certain end tags from your document. For example you are not required to close a table cell or row. This will dramatically cut down your document size if your page has a massive table.

You know what a blog is. 2. You understand what RSS does (knowing what it stands for is not a requisite). 3. You like to get the most \"bang for your buck.\"\n\n<img style=\"float:right;\" src=\"http://simplepie.org/images/logo_simplepie_horizontal.png\"/>Let me introduce you all to a handy little open-source project known as <a href=\"http://simplepie.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SimplePie</a>. SimplePie is, in my estimation, the most developed RSS parsing package available (next is <a href=\"http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Magpie</a>). In general terms the way it works is this: a blogger blogs a blogpost &gt; RSS feed is fed &gt; SimplePie puts the new info on a page that you choose. It works through the magic of PHP (of course) and can be fed any kind of XML feed like ATOM or RSS 1.0/2.0. Anything that an RSS feed pushes out, SimplePie can render on your page in a looping fashion.\n\nAn example then: WolfBlogs + departmental webpage. A little while ago our college (the College of Natural Resources) began using the Library's blogging software that they labeled \"WolfBlogs\" (of course it has \"wolf\" in it). This was because our college needed to update the way we handled news, we needed modern methods to reach larger audiences and thus extend the reach of stories created. And because I like using existing services over re-inventing wheels, we went with WolfBlogs. But this article is about SimplePie, so back to that. <a href=\"http://cnr.ncsu.edu/prtm/news/\" target=\"_blank\">Take a look at this</a>. What you are seeing is SimplePie's handiwork. These are the last 5 entries from \"<a href=\"http://blogs.lib.ncsu.edu/cnrnews/\" target=\"_blank\">CNR News Central</a>\" that were tagged \"prtm\". Here's <a href=\"http://cnr.ncsu.edu/fer/news/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">another example</a> where you replace \"prtm\" with \"fer.\" By the way, these are departmental acronyms. Additionally it makes a nice long listed <a href=\"http://cnr.ncsu.edu/prtm/news/archive.php\" target=\"_blank\">archive</a> too for people who are interested in that sort of thing.\n\nSimplePie is billed as putting the simple back into Really Simple Syndication and I'd agree. Setup is a snap. Simple as throwing an include in your site and adjusting some simple server privilege settings. SimplePie doesn't really write on a given page, but it does write to a folder you create for caching. Thus it doesn't run anew every time a visitor hits the page, instead it'll draw from the cache.\n\nSo there ya go. A super easy way to extend the content you're writing in your blogs (the getting more bang for your buck part). I know there's SimplePie modules for Drupal too by the way if that's how you get down.\n\nAnd one more footnote, shortly after deciding to write this I read this <a href=\"http://simplepie.org/blog/2009/09/26/simplepie-is-ceasing-development/\" target=\"_blank\">note</a>. Not very cool. But hey, it has all the functionality I really care to have at this point so it serves me well even if it were never further developed.\n\nAnd I'll throw this in as an extra treat for anyone who actually read this whole article: <a href=\"http://www.feedmyinbox.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FeedMyInbox</a>. This is the solution for all those folks who are afraid of RSS aggregators - it turns every post into a new email from a given feed. You can even setup a custom form for your feed on your website (e.g. <a href=\"http://cnr.ncsu.edu/prtm/news/emailfeed.php\" target=\"_blank\">this</a>).","createdDate":"2009-11-10T13:10:17.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-11-11T00:43:08.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:10079","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","description":"Zend_Feed will do that as well, and it does a great job.

If all your application needs to be able to do is read from a single database, that should be the only permission it should have.\nRule #2: Server side field validation is the only kind you can trust. Using JavaScript to do field validation is a user interface feature, not a security feature. Make sure whatever fields are coming in look exactly as you expect them to look (functions like intval() can help) before shoving them into the database or elsewhere. Additionally, use escaping functions (like mysql_real_escape_string()) or prepared statements to help avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities.\nRule #3: Beware of the LIKE keyword. Some people think that LIKE is the magical do everything keyword and use it for equality checking as well. This is very very bad. If someone puts in the percent character as their name, unity = '%' will return no results. unity LIKE '%' on the other hand will return the database to the screen.\nRule #4: Limiting your LIKE love. If at all possible, don't search for a string in the middle of a value (i.e. LIKE '%blah%'). If they leave it blank or put in a space, the full database comes out. Usually starts with (LIKE 'blah%') or ends with (LIKE '%blah') are more accurately what you are looking for. Additionally, starts with can leverage indexes.\nRule #5: Have some required fields. If a certain set of fields must not be empty (such as WRAP_USERID, SUBJECT, YEAR, SEMESTER) check them all and prevent the application from continuing if they are not provided or empty.\nRule #6: End execution after sending a Location header. header('Location: goaway.php'); should always be followed by your preferred variant of die() or exit().

I was an early adopter way back when you needed invitations to get an account. Over the years, I have started to depend on GMail for my everyday productivity.\n\nWhile GMail rocks the house, there was one part that always kinda bugged me about it...the lack of desktop notifications. As I was looking for a solution, I came across the <a href=\"http://toolbar.google.com/gmail-helper/notifier_mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">GMail notifier for OS X</a> and that did the trick! It would tell me when I had new messages, and even integrated with Google Calendar.\n\nThe notifier worked for me for a while, but then I started to collect extra GMail accounts. I am now up to 5 GMail accounts, so having 5 versions of the notifier running (which you have to hack in anyway) wasn't really a very good solution. It was also annoying that I had to have 5 browser tabs dedicated to GMail accounts in my web browser. This seemed to clutter up my workflow and really get in the way. That is when I discovered <a href=\"http://mailplaneapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mailplane</a>.\n\n<p style=\"float: right;\"><img src=\"discussions/35-Mailplane.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\nMailplane is OS X-based software that allows you to manage as many GMail accounts as you want in a desktop application-like setting. It has a few can't-miss features that I love.\n\n<b>Awesome Feature #1 - Integration with Growl</b>\n\nIf you are a mac user and don't use growl, you are missing out on an awesome product. Growl is a notification system that all my other apps integrate with nicely, and so does Mailplane. Whenever I get a new email in any of my GMail accounts, I get a growl notification. It is wonderful.\n<b>\nAwesome Feature #2 - Drag and Drop Attachments</b>\n\nYep, you can drag an attachment from your desktop, into Mailplane, and bam! Attached to an email. Saves a lot of time.\n<b>\nAwesome Feature #3 - More Notifications</b>\n\nMailplane comes with a GMail-Notifier-esque icon that is in your menu bar that will tell you how many unread messages you have. You have an option in the preferences to check every account or just the active one.\n\n<b>Awesome Feature #4 - Do Not Disturb mode</b>\n\nHave you ever been really concentrating on a project and you get a notification that you have new email? With Mailplane, you can turn on \"Do Not Disturb\" mode and you won't get any more notifications. Great for concentration.\n\nThere are more awesome features, but I will let you figure those out for yourself. Sorry Windows people, Mailplane is only for OS X. It does cost money after the 30 day free trial, but they give discounts for education, so the license only ends up costing about $18. I realize in a world of free software and other alternatives, that seems like a lot. But I have been using it for a few weeks and I will definitely be shelling out the money for Mailplane. It is that awesome...and that is why it is the best thing ever.\n\nFor more info on Mailplane, check out the 2 minute video on their <a href=\"http://mailplaneapp.com\" target=\"_blank\">homepage</a>.","createdDate":"2009-10-27T15:05:01.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-10-27T15:06:27.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!"},{"id":"2486881:Topic:9881","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","title":"Zend PHP Coference 2009","description":"I just got back from <a href=\"http://zendcon.com\" target=\"_blank\">ZendCon 2009</a> and thought I would share my experiences.

If you're still copying your files to a zip disk and walking them across town then my friend, you need a car. And a Dropbox download!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.getdropbox.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dropbox</a> is a cross-platform application for sharing files. Create a (free!) account on the Dropbox website and a quick download later you've got a directory mapped to your machine ready to store up to 2GB of your files on the Dropbox secure servers! This is cloud computing on a bright, sunny day, folks. Your PC, Mac and Linux machines will share in ways Bill and Steve never dreamed. Naturally, you'll be so pleased that you'll rush about downloading Dropbox for your home machine, your laptop, mom's PC and on that machine across town. But wait! You can also manage your Dropbox files via the web and with their recently released iPhone app. Been frustrated with the challenges of managing your iPhone files? Weep no more, 'lil camper. The iPhone app will let you upload your images and view a wide, WIDE array of file types including images, music files, movies, PDF, document and presentation files. And more.\n\nIn case this isn't incentive enough you can also manage the sharing of your documents on Dropbox. Files in the \"Public\" space have a URL which can be shared with anyone. Other folders are private by default but can be shared with other Dropbox users. And in case you fear that all this yummy sharing might lead to editing conflicts or accidental deletions you can relax, Frankie. Dropbox keeps all your files, even the deleted ones, and has version controls in case multiple people are working on a file at once. And if you're the shy type, feel better knowing Dropbox uses SSL and AES-256 encryption for its file transfers.\n\n\"Jen, is there ANYTHING you don't LOVE about Dropbox?\" Well, yes. Yes there is. For one thing I can't seem to make good use of the Dropbox files on my phone. They're available in the Dropbox app, but difficult to get at otherwise. Making an image a Favorite doesn't put it in my \"Photos\". So unless I take a screenshot (press and hold the \"Home\" button at center bottom of the iPhone, then press and release the \"Sleep\" button on top right of the iPhone) I can't really play with my photo.\nI'm also bitterly and irrationally disappointed about the fact that my free account only give me 2GB of space. I'm really being silly here: it's free space and Dropbox gives ample opportunities to earn additional storage (up to 5GB with a free account) by simply using the application or signing up friends (Hey, friends! <a href=\"https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTE4MDIzNDg5\" target=\"_blank\">Go sign up</a>!). There are also \"Pro\" options that allow you to bump up your Dropbox space significantly, but at $9.99 a month for the 50GB option ($19.99/ month for 100GB) it's a bit steep. That being said I use my Dropbox quite a bit and have only used 1.3% of my space.\n\nPlenty of folks have made good use of Dropbox for some more elaborate sharing. Symlink a profile or bookmark directory to Dropbox and enjoy an identical experience on your machines. Store a <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5133679/five-best-portable-applications\" target=\"_blank\">portable app</a> for use anywhere. Map your <a href=\"http://ncsuwebdev.ning.com/forum/topics/boxee-tv-ouside-the-box\" target=\"_blank\">Boxee</a> to the Dropbox folder for quick access to shared media files (legal ones only, of course). The possibilities are fantastic.\n\nIf you'd like a Dropbox account go sign up now, preferably by <a href=\"https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTE4MDIzNDg5\" target=\"_blank\">clicking here</a> and using me as a referral so I can get more Dropbox file space. Download it, share it, spread the word. This one is a no-brainer, my friends. It's totally the best thing ever.

This application is built on their OT Framework, which is built on Zend Framework.

I'm here to tell you that it's pretty sweet. Will it eliminate the need for email? I don't think so. Is it a great way to collaborate on a conversation / document? Yes, yes it is!\n\nGoogle says that Wave is their idea of what would be created if email had been invented today. The idea is that you have one document / conversation (a docuversation?) that you can collaborate on in real time with the people participating in the wave (the recipients, essentially). So rather than have to create an email and send it to the various recipients and then rely on them to actually reply all appropriately, you can just use Wave to accomplish this task. This way you have one conversation rather than having to deal with a bunch of copies of emails. You can use Wave for organizing events, meeting notes, group reports, brainstorming, sharing photos,\n\nJason and I have been using it to collaborate and share files for some of our projects. It's convenient to be able to make notes and add files and have a conversation that's fully searchable all in one place.\n\nGoogle has added the ability to create widgets for Wave (similar to Gmail) so it's capabilities can be extended easily. There are various widgets already: voting &amp; polls, maps, trip planning, video conferencing, etc.\n\nThey also have a concept of robots that can be added to a Wave. For example, you can add a real-time language translation robot to Wave. If my language is French and Jason is in English, it will translate what I'm saying in French, in real time, to English for Jason to read.\n\nThere are a thousand videos and blog posts on Google Wave, so I'm not going to rehash all of that. I'll just link to a few informative resources:\n\n<a href=\"http://web.appstorm.net/roundups/communication-roundups/8-google-wave-resources-while-you-wait/\" target=\"_blank\">http://web.appstorm.net/roundups/communication-roundups/8-google-wave-resources-while-you-wait/</a>\n<a href=\"%20http://web.appstorm.net/roundups/communication-roundups/extend-your-wave-%E2%80%A6-eventually/\" target=\"_blank\">\n</a><a href=\"http://web.appstorm.net/roundups/communication-roundups/extend-your-wave-%E2%80%A6-eventually/\">http://web.appstorm.net/roundups/communication-roundups/extend-your-wave-%E2%80%A6-eventually/</a>\n\nI see a lot of potential in Google Wave, especially as more and more people get accounts :-) I'd venture to guess that they'll start opening it up pretty soon to a larger audience.

Wave handles threading, filtering, sorting, and folder organization; the inbox is there, and blips tell the Wave whether they are replying to one of my blips or not.\n\nThe protocol specs suggest to me that the bottleneck to making it behave like email is in the client UI and in the policies of the Wave service provider.

If you can put yourself in their shoes and step through their process, you can get a better perspective for where they are coming from. Perhaps that feature request that you think is asinine is actually really worthwhile. This is actually a really difficult task. Many times, even though your client may go through a certain workflow 10 times a day, they have never really sat down and written it out or explained it to someone.

Thanks Mike!\n\n----------------------\n\nIf you're responsible for the design, content, or marketing of your website you'll certainly appreciate what <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Trends</a> can offer you.\n\nGoogle Trends lets you compare how often certain keywords or phrases have been searched for (on Google) over time.\nWhy is this useful?\n\nSay you are having a dispute within your team about one of the navigation items on your new site. Several of your team members think the link should read \"<b>Current Students</b>\", while others are deadset on using \"<b>Prospective Students</b>\". Of course there's always the one guy who doesn't agree with anybody and wants the section to be called \"<b>New Students</b>\". So who's suggestion is the best?\n\nGoogle Trends can help settle the dispute with data.\n\nSimply enter your keywords (or phrases) into Google Trends, separating each with a comma (you may enter up to five items).\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"discussions/42-search.gif\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<b>The Results</b>\n\nThe graph can be a bit confusing and difficult to digest at first, but it's really delivering a pretty clear message. The results for this particular comparison shows us that for every Google search for \"<b>Current Students</b>\" there were approximately 5.4 Google searches for \"<b>New Students</b>\". The other charts on the results page will even tell you how the phrases rank against each other in different parts of the world (This can be particularly useful if your site is targeting international students). You'll also get a legend that outlines popular stories in the news over the past few years that may have contributed a spike in search volume. Each of those news items is flagged with\n\nSo Essentially\u2026\nNew Students &gt; Current Students &gt; Prospective Students\n\nThis makes perfect sense. Would you really expect high school seniors to be googling (or searching your site) for the term \"prospective students\", probably not. Knowing which terms or phrases resonate best with your users will help make your content richer in the long run and you'll start connecting with more users from search.\n<b>\nOther Practical Comparisons to Try</b>\n\n* <a href=\"http://google.com/trends?q=NCST,+NCSU,+NC+STATE&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0\" target=\"_blank\">NCST, NCSU, NC STATE</a>\n* <a href=\"http://google.com/trends?q=international+study,+study+away,+study+abroad&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0\" target=\"_blank\">international study, study away, study abroad</a>\n\n<b>What else can trends tell me?</b>\n\nBecause the keywords and phrases are graphed for their popularity over time, you can detect patterns. For instance, check out this comparison between \"march madness\" and \"super bowl\"\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"discussions/43-results2.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\nAs you can see from the chart (over the past 5 years), the phrase 'super bowl' is googled more often than 'march madness' (6 times more to be precise). However, you should also note that both phrases are typically only googled during a specific time of year. Makes sense, doesn't it?\n\n<b>News correlates with Search Volume</b>\n\nWhether a big story just broke in the tabloids or your favorite team just won the championship game, you can bet that the attention the topic is getting in the news will have some impact on it's search volume on Google.\n\nTake a look at this comparison between \"obama\", \"palin\" and \"jackson\"\u2026\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"discussions/44-results3.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\nThe small graph at the bottom (News Reference Volume) represents the number of occurences for each topic in Google News during that time period. As you can see, Sarah Palin wasn't appearing very much in the news until mid 2008.\n\nGoogle has also flagged (with letters) points in time when major news stories broke. Sometimes these headlines can explain a major spike in searches. For instance, when it was reported that Michael Jackson had died... searches for 'Michael Jackson' went through the roof (point F).\n\n<b>Have any burning questions?</b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/trends/about.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read more about Google Trends</a>\n\nWant to do some more advanced things with Google Trends?

This got me on the trail of trying to figure out why...\n\nThe first reason was because the browser has to load the external file when it gets to it, causing the page to slow down when it loads. Sounds like a good plan to speed up your page being shown, but it seems to fall apart when you have dynamic elements which javascript handles. If your page loads, and your JS takes some action on your page (like using jQuery to make sliders), your viewer is going to see your page without those dynamic elements, then once the script gets loaded...poof! Your site changes and the user doesn't really know what happened.

I'm pretty sure I disagree with this reasoning as well, because every JS framework around has a method for on-page-load or on-dom-ready. It seems like writing your JS so that it executes before you know your object you need is in the DOM is a poor way to write your javascript.\n\nSo what gives? Are you guys doing your JS like this?

I don't know that you can guarantee that the DOM has completely loaded just because the bottom of the page has been reached. That's exactly what DOM ready checks are for.\n\nBut aside from that, there is a difference in the two methodologies.\n\nJavascript in the body will be executed while the page loads, and javascript in the head will be executed when called.\n\nAdditionally, scripts in the head are ensured to be loaded before anyone can use it. So, if you have javascript that handles some click event, then you run the risk of having someone click the link or button before the javascript is loaded if you load the javascript at the end of the body.\n\nThat's all relatively straightforward, but not really relevant to the question if you assume you're going to initialize your javascript when the DOM is ready anyway.\n\nSo that brings up the question, if you're going to do it that way, is it any faster to put your JS at the bottom of the page?\n\nHere's what Google has to say about deferring the loading of javascript...which is essentially what we're talking about.\n\n---- From <a href=\"http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/payload.html#DeferLoadingJS\" target=\"_blank\">http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/payload.html#DeferLoadingJS</a> ------\n\nLike stylesheets, scripts must be downloaded, parsed, and executed before the browser can begin to render a web page. Again, even if a script is contained in an external file that is cached, processing of all elements below the script is blocked until the browser loads the code from disk and executes it. However, for some browsers, the situation is worse than for stylesheets: while JavaScript is being processed, the browser blocks all other resources from being downloaded. For AJAX-type applications that use many bytes of JavaScript code, this can add considerable latency.\n\nFor many script-intensive applications, the bulk of the JavaScript code handles user-initiated events, such as mouse-clicking and dragging, form entry and submission, hidden elements expansion, and so on. All of these user-triggered events occur after the page is loaded and the onload event is triggered. Therefore, much of the delay in the \"critical path\" (the time to load the main page at startup) could be avoided by deferring the loading of the JavaScript until it's actually needed. While this \"lazy\" method of loading doesn't reduce the total JS payload, it can significantly reduce the number of bytes needed to load the initial state of the page, and allows the remaining bytes to be loaded asynchronously in the background.\n\nTo use this technique, you should first identify all of the JavaScript functions that are not actually used by the document before the onload event. For any file containing more than 25 uncalled functions, move all of those functions to a separate, external JS file. This may require some refactoring of your code to work around dependencies between files. (For files containing fewer than 25 uncalled functions, it's not worth the effort of refactoring.)\n\n---------------------------------\n\nSo the short answer is: it might speed up your page a little bit, but in the end it really depends on the complexity of your code, the size of your code, and what exactly that code does. There is no catch-all 100% true all of the time rule. Some things will need to happen before the page is rendered, and others can wait. It's up to the specific application.\n\nBut the bottom line is that there's a trade off. It's not wrong to put them in the head or in the body and it won't make much of a difference unless you have a lot of javascript and can refactor it to defer the loading of functionality that you don't need until after the page has loaded.","createdDate":"2009-10-01T16:36:37.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:9393","contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","description":"The only reason i can think of, to put the javascript at the base of the page, is if the javascript has no effect on the initial rendering of the page.

The quest is always for better quality given the limits of a broadband connection, while also offering the audience a transparent experience. Flash Video has become a dominant form of internet based video. However, concurrent with this, we have seen the rapid adoption of MPEG-4 as a de facto standard for tightly compressed video necessarily for both mobile devices and the web. The compression technology known as \"h264\" gave MPEG-4 a significant boost in the quality/size ratio, and is what is often used for video on mobile devices, and also as a compression format for consumer high definition video cameras (also known as AVCHD).\n\nAdobe's flash technology supports FLV as it's default video format. Like Quicktime, and MPEG-4, FLV is a container that can use a variety of compression technologies. In FLV's case, it is the ancient Sorenson compression technology or newer (but still not cutting edge) On2 compression.\n\nFlash 9 introduced support for MPEG-4/h264 as a playback technology. Many assumed that this meant that Flash's proprietary video container was updated to support these new compression technologies, but it goes much further than that. Flash Developers can use standard mpeg-4/h264 video in their projects with no modification. What this means is that you can create just one file that meets your needs for both web delivery and for other purposes, such as a podcast feed, and also benefit from h264's ability to offer better quality video.\n\nIt is important to note here that your compressed video must be \"real\" mpeg-4 files; Qucktime files using h264 compression (those that end with .mov) are not supported. Many tools exist that can create mpeg-4 content for you from your existing video; If there is more interest in this topic I will cover it in an upcoming article.\n\nSeveral options are available to use Flash to play back your mpeg-4 media. We will focus on two; using a custom player, and using an off-the-shelf Flash Video player combined with the \"embed\" tag. It is important to note here that while the \"embed\" tag has been deprecated in the latest HTML specifications, browsers have not completely moved to the alternative option, the \"video\" tag. Again, I can cover this in an additional article if there's interest.\n\nIf you have a smattering of knowledge of Actionscript (Flash's programming language), you can build a custom Flash player that will call mpeg-4 files. Essentially, this is a flash project that either points to the specific file itself, or perhaps an xml file that lists the files to be played. Building a custom flash player is useful because:\n\n- better user experience through a custom player interface\n- utilizes the same compression settings and flies that you can use for other venues, such as podcasting\n- obscures the mpeg-4 file, making it difficult for users to download (if that is your goal)\n\nFor more information, check out <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/hd_video_flash_player.html\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a> on Adobe's site that goes into much more detail, and includes some source code examples that could be used as the basis for a custom player.\n\nThe good news is that you don't have to actually code a flash player to make use of Flash's playback of MPEG-4. JWPlayer is a pre-built flash media player that exists in a free and commercial version. The simplest way to use it is to create a piece of code that embeds the player and loads your file, such as:\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"discussions/45-code.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\nThis was created with <a href=\"http://www.longtailvideo.com\" target=\"_blank\">Longtail Media</a>'s online code generator, which makes it super easy.\n\nNote in this example that it is playing back a 1024x768 frame size, just about right for those using presentation capture software (Camtasia, Relay, Apple's Quicktime X, etc).\n\nThere are two version of JWPlayer available; a free version and a commercial version. The free version displays a watermark that briefly shows up when your video begins to play; the commercial version removes that watermark, and is specifically for sites that are commercial (have ads, promote products, owned by corporations). It has a very extensive feature set, including support for captioning, streaming and skinning (custom user experience).\n\nFlash playback of MPEG-4 really bridges two worlds; the simplicity of Flash as a playback component for end users, and the quality and variety of frame sizes that mpeg4/h264 can provide, up to an online HD video experience. YouTube's HD playback uses MPEG-4 with a Flash player for this exact reason.\n\n<b>Resources:</b>\n\nExample of JW Player in Web Page\n<a href=\"http://www.ncsu.edu/it/multimedia/video/mediaplayer/test.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ncsu.edu/it/multimedia/video/mediaplayer/test.html</a>\n\nJW Player\n<a href=\"http://www.longtailvideo.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.longtailvideo.com</a>\n\nJW Player Code Generator\n<a href=\"http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player-setup-wizard\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player-setup-wizard</a>\n\nExcellent overview of Flash Playback of HD MPEG-4 (with Actionscript code examples)\n<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/hd_video_flash_player.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/hd_video_flash_player.html</a>\n\nFlash 9 Video Support Overview\n<a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flash_Player:9:Update:H.264\" target=\"_blank\">http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flash_Player:9:Update:H.264</a>","createdDate":"2009-09-22T13:08:45.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-09-22T15:56:08.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:9272","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"Sadly, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC\" target=\"_blank\">H.264</a> is a patent encumbered video compression standard. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora\" target=\"_blank\">Theora</a>, on the other hand, is a royalty-free, open video compression standard.\n\nSupport is available in Firefox 3.5 and Google Chrome.

Anyone that uses the internet needs to keep track of passwords. But how to do this in a secure and flexible way?\n\nThere are many password managers available, but most of them require that specific fields be set up for each password, and these fields have fixed lengths. If you need to save information that is more free-form, these solutions usually don't work.\n\nI used to keep my passwords on an encrypted disk image on a flash drive. Unfortunately, this requires access to a computer.\n\nThe best solution that I have found is Memengo (<a href=\"http://www.memengo.com\">http://www.memengo.com</a>). Memengo is a web based password manager that also has iPhone and Windows Mobile versions. The web site is free, and the iPhone app is $4.99.\n\nAfter creating an account on Memengo, you create a wallet, which contains your passwords. A encryption phrase/word is created, which secures the wallet. This password is different from the Memengo login password.\n\nA wallet contains pages which contain the actual password information. The pages can be grouped in a folder (personal, work, etc). When a page is created, a page type is selected. There are a number of different formats like \"Bank Account\", \"Credit Cards\", \"Phone Numbers\", but I like to use the \"Free-form Note\". The \"Free-form note\" is a plain text file with no formatting. To transfer my passwords, I cut and pasted my old password files into individual Memengo cards. I like to keep these cards relatively small to allow for faster and easier editing.\n\nI was initially concerned about storing my passwords on the internet, but the wallet is saved as an encrypted file on the Memengo site, and decrypted when the wallet password is entered. So the only data stored online is encrypted.\n\nThe Memengo Wallet iPhone/iPod Touch app ($4.99) syncs with the Memengo web site and caches a copy of the encrypted wallet. Since I generally have my iPod Touch with me, I always have access to my passwords. I find that it is generally easier to edit the password files on my desktop computer, but the password files are also editable on the iPod Touch.","createdDate":"2009-09-15T12:16:05.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-09-15T12:16:05.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!"},{"id":"2486881:Topic:9102","contributorName":"36mexpty3zftm","title":"Best Thing Ever: JSBin.com","description":"<a href=\"http://jsbin.com\" target=\"_blank\">jsbin.com</a>\n\nI don't know about you, but I do a lot of Javascript development. As such, I often get questions about how to do things. For example, the other week someone asked me how to make a message box fade out a few seconds after the page loaded using jQuery.\n\nThis isn't a hard thing to do, but it can get tedious to explain exactly how to make it happen without either going to their desk and showing them, or sending them a fully-functioning example. But that can take a lot more time than it really should. So you usually just end up going over there and helping or wasting a lot of your time making an example, or giving them a snarky link to lmgtfy.com.\n\nBut with the help of jsbin.com you no longer have to choose one of those options!\n\nJS Bin is an invaluable tool for showing someone how to do something simple, or getting help on a bug you might be trying to fix.

It will automatically generate an html page that includes your selected library from a content distribution network (CDN) and lets you view the output in another tab.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"discussions/46-20090908_0927.png?width=500\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"318\"/></p>\n\nWhen you're finished tweaking your code, you can use the generated public link so you can send it to people and they can see the entire script in one page.\n\nJSBin.com has saved me a lots of time trying to debug complex Javascript and has enabled me to create examples for people in very little time.\n\nThat's why JSBin.com is this week's best thing ever!","createdDate":"2009-09-08T13:30:33.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-09-09T15:45:22.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:9126","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"Awesome, thanks.","createdDate":"2009-09-09T15:45:22.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:9123","contributorName":"36mexpty3zftm","description":"That is the default example built into jsbin.com...which you'll see every time you go there.

And if, like me, you're stressing a little at putting that much personal financial information into one place, <a href=\"http://www.mint.com/privacy/\" target=\"_blank\">Mint.com shares the ways they keep you and your information safe</a>.\n\nOnce your accounts are in there, Mint.com maintains a little balance sheet (left-hand column) so you know where you are overall (financially anyway). It also extracts the data to form pretty charts and graphs that tell you where your money is going over in the 'Trends' section. Naturally a mortgage/ car payment/ poor-retirement-planning can make this balance sheet look terrifyingly in the red, so keep a paper bag handy for the first time you take a good look at your finances in all their technicolor-GUI glory.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"discussions/47-mint.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\nNow you're ready to start making Mint.com work for you. Check out the 'Emails &amp; Alerts' section to choose when you should get emails and/or text messages for things like low balance warnings, bill paying reminders, unusual spending and going over budget. Don't want to be harassed? Pull your information instead by downloading the FREE mint.com iPhone app. This gives you the latest balance information on all your accounts, warnings on balances and spending and will let you monitor your budget. I was less than pleased that the app doesn't have a lock or password feature (though it doesn't display your account information) but felt much better after a recent upgrade added a feature where you can deactivate the application via the Mint.com website.\n\nNot sold yet? One of my favorite things to do (in a masochistic, \"what-was-I-thinking\" sense) is going through my \"Transactions\". This is all the withdrawals and deposits to all my accounts and they're categorized to help with budgeting. You can also apply tags (the initial ones include \"Vacation\", \"Reimbursable\" and \"Tax Related\") to help you keep an eye on things that might be important later, or may be anomalies in the normal monthly bills. It's an eye-opener at the end of the month to see just where all your money is going (seriously?? On coffee!?) and really helps the next time you think about doing, say, a house renovation, for example. Once you realize how bad you are at managing your money you can use the budget tools in the \"Planning\" section to work out your fixed costs and budget the rest of your monthly paycheck. These features have recently been improved so I haven't played with them all but it's nice to know the Mint folks are keeping things fresh (pun intended).\n\nMint.com has a few ads, mostly in the financial sector, and occasionally they bug you with pop-ups about how you could be saving money by switching to this credit card at this rate, etc. I went down that rabbit hole once but never really got anything but a sales pitch. I also get frustrated with the Transactions being mis-categorized (which obviously can really do some weird stuff to your budgeting), but this happens surprisingly rarely. Mint.com knows Borders is 'Books', International Tile is 'Home Improvement' and it has learned that Reverie is my coffee shop.\n\nSo all in all this very easy, nicely pastel-ish, and completely free tool has made my finances much prettier (if not more significant). It's nice to know there's something keeping an eye on my money, even when I'm not. Stop reading right now and go sign up for Mint.com 'cause it's absolutely The Best Thing Ever (this week).","createdDate":"2009-09-01T14:02:08.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-09-14T20:06:34.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:9166","contributorName":"3p7bzgj31hmap","description":"170 million.. holy cow.","createdDate":"2009-09-14T20:06:34.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:9164","contributorName":"0lqnwngbukofs","description":"Saw this article today about Mint being acquired:\n\n<a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10351715-2.html\">http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10351715-2.html</a>","createdDate":"2009-09-14T17:17:13.000Z"}]},{"id":"2486881:Topic:8805","contributorName":"3eskgaralqbpn","title":"CFinNC Conference","description":"Greetings, all.

In that time, Linux has grown from being a plaything of hobbyists to becoming an enterprise-ready operating system capable of competing with the likes of AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, and Microsoft Windows. One way that early Linux promoters used to increase interest in Linux was to produce live CDs. A live CD is a CD that boots to an operating system that doesn't rely on any other storage to become a fully operational machine. The very first Linux distribution offered in Live CD form was Yggdrasil Linux, way back in 1992-1993. Think about using 1x CD drives on a 386dx running at 33Mhz trying to bring up a full GUI based desktop and you'll realize why those first forays into live CDs didn't take the world by storm. Fast forward ten years, to the halcyon days of 2003, when Knoppix was unleashed upon the world by Klaus Knopper [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_cd\" target=\"_blank\">cite</a>].\n\nKnoppix was built from the ground up to not merely boot the operating system to a bare shell prompt, oh no. It was designed to poke and prod your hardware to do its darndest to be up, running, and fully available by the time you see a pretty graphical desktop environment. It's entertaining just to burn a CD or DVD image of the thing to watch how much stuff it finds on your machine to make use of. Hard drives are scanned and shown via icons (nothing is modified unless you do so, however), portable storage is shown, networking is started if possible, sound is auto-configured (and you know its working because the startup sound is a female voice saying \"Initiating startup procedure\"), and all of the things that nay-sayers whine about are simply done for you automagically. To steal a line from the Mac fanboys, \"It Just Works\".\n\nOK, you're still not convinced, why bother with Knoppix (or any other live CD)? Why download a 700Mb iso file for CD or 2+Gb iso file for DVD to get Linux? I'm glad you asked. Here are just a few reasons:\n\n<b>* Privacy.</b> Boot a CD, do anything you want, shut down, and all evidence of your actions are gone.\n<b>* With just an optical disc and a USB stick, every computer becomes \"your\" computer.</b> The latest versions of Knoppix let you save preferences and files to USB to retrieve once you've booted. Viruses? What viruses?\n<b>* Rescue mode.</b> Here's where you can be the hero of the hour. Boot Knoppix, make necessary fixes to a sick machine's hard drive, reboot, and you're gonna get some major love.\n<b>* Play mode.</b> You've heard about Linux, but don't want your highly tweaked main operating system to be destroyed. Boot Knoppix and see what everyone is raving about. Boot some other OS other than Linux. Return to your \"normal\" computer with a simple Ctrl-Alt-Delete.\n<b>* Appliance mode.</b> Besides Knoppix, there's tons of specialty live CDs that are tailored for audiences such as Tivo like video recorders, music and sound creation and editing, high end 3-d graphics, games, web publishing, and on and on. Let others do the hard work of combining operating systems, libraries, and applications. All you have to do is plop in a disc, fire up the machine, and start using.\n<b>* Test mode.</b> Booting a live CD gives you another operating system to run diagnostic tests on hardware, whether hard drive, memory, CPU, or something else. Your hardware vendor blames the OS? Tell 'em it's time to give you an RMA on that dead whatever.\n<b>* Cred mode.</b> When you get to that Monster/Dice/whoever job form and they ask what environments you're familiar with, do you wanna list only one? Of course you don't. Become a real Power User.\n\n\nTo give you an example of the power of the live CD, the Ubuntu folks decided that their install CD would actually be a live CD. That is, unlike RedHat, where you have to get a special live version, Ubuntu lets you use their single CD to boot immediately to a running OS. If you like it, you can perform an install from this running image. Reboot, and the same computing environment you were using from CD is now safely tucked onto your hard drive. How awesome is that? Try that with Windows 7 and see how far you get.\n\nFor those of you who can't escape the Windows world, there is an option: live CD building tools. One famous exampe is Bart PE. See, unlike the free software Linux world, you can't just download Windows live CDs (that would be what we in the tech world call \"Illegal\"). Rather, you download software that lets you build a live CD ISO file by using data from your own Windows install CD. I've had good luck with one called <a href=\"http://www.ubcd4win.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ultimate Boot CD for Windows.</a>\n\nHave I used live CDs? You betcha. I've done Ubuntu installs, I've tried out other flavors of Linux, I've rescued a few Windows machines from the brink of death. In the last few months I've been using Knoppix to diagnose network configurations with blade servers my team is working with. Having a self-contained OS + complete set of diagnostic tools of all kinds makes it dead easy to figure out where things are Going South.\n\nSo, you've bought into my sales pitch, and you wanna get you some of that there live CD.

That doesn't mean that it isn't on my radar, however - I see two options for going forward:\n\n1) Provide documentation for users instructing them to update their browser for files over a certain threshold. This isn't unreasonable, as IE6 and IE7 were built with certain expectations about Internet transfers in an age when an 8GB file download was simply a whimsical what-if scenario. Advising users to update to IE8 or later to perform actions that older browsers just can't handle is certainly the kind of thing that people have heard before. You could also advise them to use one of the alternate browsers if they absolutely do not want IE8 for some reason.\n\nSide thought: I'm surprised to see that Chrome isn't in that list. Was it simply not tested, or does it also have the 2/4 GB limit?\n\n2) Build an alternate download mechanism. As I've already built a Java program to get around the 2GB file upload limitation of modern browsers, building a related download program (or even better, integrate the two functions into one program) seemed only natural. However, in practice I have found that using the user's web browser for downloads is easy and reliable and fast enough that there hasn't been a reason to do the extra work for a simplistic file transfer solution.\n\nHowever, I've been working (albeit in a low priority mode) on a Java-based downloader in order to implement additional features - two very specific, widely-requested features, in fact: the ability to download multiple files in a single action, and the ability to transfer file and directory hierarchies. Currently, a rather poor workaround for this has been to zip several files (or directory structures) together, transfer the zip file, and have the user extract them. With a Java-based downloader, downloading several files at the same time and writing them into the correct directory hierarchy becomes very easy. Well, easy once the code is finished. Writing the code has turned out to be quite a fun experience. ;) On top of this, in order to maintain security and privacy expectations, such alternate downloads would have to occur via an encrypted format. When I was building the Java uploader, I looked into this and found such a rat's nest that I decided it was easier to just have a disclaimer that uploads done with that mechanism are done so insecurely. That works for one upload mechanism when there are other options for performing uploads, but expectations are such that any download is expected to be done so securely.\n\nSo, my alternate download solution to resolve a problem <i>easily solved on the user side</i> has now become tied into dependencies for three very nontrivial feature additions (multi-file download, directory hierarchy, and secure Java-based transfers). For this reason alone, I'd <b>strongly</b> recommend that you stay away from the concept of an alternate download mechanism, and instead simply post a notice on the site that files larger than [x] size will have to be downloaded via a browser in a supported list that you define.\n\nThat said, if you do end up writing it, I want the code. ;)","createdDate":"2009-08-25T16:26:56.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:8692","contributorName":"35947pweiolu5","description":"Nice info here.

You couldn't do that with X-SendFile because the file only gets sent after your script stops running. And I'm not sure, but it doesn't look like there is a way to build support for resuming file downloads with this tool. Admittedly, I haven't done this in Velocity either, but it is something on the horizon.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I can see some reasons for wanting to use X-SendFile over custom PHP (or other language) code. The ease of use is a big one - being able to send a file to the client in one or two lines is very nice.

Ours is CGI based rather than PHP, but has similar issues.\n\nIf you have to read the entire file into memory before sending it, you are doing it wrong. Alan mentioned fread and similar as a way to read a chunk and send it. That's a much better solution.\n\nExecution time limit is going to hit you based on the transfer rate of the client, not the server. If you happen to get someone with a 56k modem still in use, or perhaps even a slower broadband connection trying to get a huge file, you can expect that connection to be open a long time. If your time limit is based on CPU cycles used rather than wall-clock time, you'll probably not burn cpu doing a fread/print loop regardless of the client speed. (Excepting SSL overhead as Alan said.)\n\nHTTP/1.1 supports partial downloads. This is a good and bad thing. It's good for the client because they can do recovery from a disconnect. It's bad for our servers when so-called \"download accelerators\" make dozens if not hundreds of connections simultaneously for pieces of the same file. When your server only offers 150 connections before getting overloaded, having a single iPhone downloading 120 pieces of one file at once is a very bad thing. (Yes, this happened to wolfware earlier this week.) Back to the point, it's good if your software can be written to handle the HTTP/1.1 partial requests. That's one way to avoid the time limit. Unfortunately I've not written that into download.ncsu yet. There are other ways to handle overzealous accelerators, like mod_cband which is used on all of OIT's apache 2.2 servers.","createdDate":"2009-08-21T14:44:16.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:8623","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"Nice post!

In fact, the only performance-related issue that the service faces comes from the CPU overhead of using HTTPS for transfers - something that x-sendfile will also have problems with.\n\nThe one advantage that I see it having over my PHP-based solution is that it automatically calculates the Content-Length headers. As you're already aware, PHP has issues with files larger than 2GB due to its use of integers in file-related data structures. To work around this, I've had to issue a call to the local system to determine the size of the file and treat the resulting output as a string that gets sent in the Content-Length header. The PHP Group certainly knows about this, and there've been patches submitted to work around this problem (see: <a href=\"http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=48886\">http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=48886</a> for an example for 5.3.0).

As part of our work with the Mobile NCSU project, we had a need to be able to detect what device a user was looking at the site in so that we could optimize the view for their specific device. This means that iPhone users would get a nice, native looking iPhone interface to the site, while a smartphone user would get a slightly less graphical interface, but still nice.\n\nWe started using some python code written for the <a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/mit_to_open_source_mobile_web.php\" target=\"_blank\">MIT mobile site</a> (which we are basing the NCSU site off of) which implemented a <a href=\"http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_blank\">WURFL service</a> to do this determination. The only problem was that it was aimed directly at the MIT app, meaning that no other apps could take advantage of it. As we struggled to get the code working, we decided to take a look at WURFL more closely and see if we could implement something that anyone (or any service) could use to do the device detection.\n\nWe found a WURFL PHP library and got that up and going in no time. In front of the PHP library, we created a REST server which will return XML. This means that any app can make a request to the WURFL service and get back information.

It truly was the Best Thing Ever, as it aggregated your social networking services into one easy to use desktop client (for Windows). This week, we found out that Digsby turned towards the Dark Side, by slipping in a few extra features with their updates, and hiding some settings that you really should know about.\n\nFYI, I'm going to be rehashing what has already been said here: <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5336382/digsby-joins-the-dark-side-uses-your-pc-to-make-money\" target=\"_blank\">http://lifehacker.com/5336382/digsby-joins-the-dark-side-uses-your-pc-to-make-money</a>\n\nHere's the bottom line.\n\n1. They include 6, yes SIX, toolbars that you have to choose NOT to add when you first install Digsby. Yes this is bad, but at least they give you the option of not installing the toolbars (I've never had one install during an update, so this is just an annoyance really).\n\n2.

Hidden inside the terms of service is a little blurb about allowing them to take advantage of unused resources on your computer to conduct research for them and their partners. Possibly the worst thing, is that to turn off this \"feature\" you have to go into the \"Support Digsby\" option on the Help menu, rather than in the preferences/settings area. Granted, you can turn off the client's ability to steal your resources, but it's still a crappy way to treat your users.\n\nTo be fair, they did announce/report it on their blog (<a href=\"http://blog.digsby.com/archives/68\" target=\"_blank\">http://blog.digsby.com/archives/68</a>), and have engaged people on the Digsby forum, but they never sent out any kind of announcement to the users.

Part of my New Year's resolution was to get more involved in the tech community around Raleigh. I've been a part of the larger PHP community, and the Zend Framework community, and of course the NCSU Web Developers community. But I wanted to get out there and see what else was going on. When I started poking around, I found that we have quite an active tech community here in the Triangle! I was pleasantly surprised, but I wasn't sure how to get involved, so when I stumbled upon the <a href=\"http://barcamprdu.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BarCampRDU website</a> and found the organizer, I emailed him and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBarCampRDU was this past weekend and I got to meet a lot of really great folks. Most of the people I met were in the commercial side of life, but we all shared lots of commonalities. I even participated in the BarCamp process and gave a pitch about how to handle feedback. There were about 15 people in my session, and we had a great discussion about how to effectively handle feedback. I heard from a few friends that it was the talk with the best discussion surrounding it, so that made me feel good. I also got about 20 new followers on twitter, which is great for networking in the future.\n\n<a href=\"http://igniteraleigh.com/\" target=\"_blank\">#IgniteRaleigh</a> also went down this past week.

There are tweetups about every month, where people from twitter meetup in real life and talk tech, have some drinks, and just have a good time. John Martin also told me about \"Startup Weekend\" where you get together, come up with an idea for a startup, and try to implement it, all in one weekend. That sounds totally awesome, and I am on board with that when it comes around again.\n\nThe point I am trying to make is that we have a very active tech community in the RDU area, and they can be an invaluable resource.

Folks from all over the country are using Billboard to manage their digital signage, and we feel like that is important to the maturation of the product to keep it going. They have been able to take advantage of the Open Source BSD license that we released Billboard under and that has saved many thousands of dollars, at NCSU and beyond.\n\nWith that in mind, we have decided to embrace that diversity and run the Billboard development as a true open source project. This is a little different than just releasing the code as open source. We are going to be embracing the entire Open Source experience, inviting anyone and everyone to participate in the development of Billboard. That means we need people to help write code, formulate proposals, discuss ideas, and direct the project into being the great piece of software that we know it can be.\n\nI must note that we have the support of our management to run the project this way, which is a big shift in how we normally run projects.

WRAP","description":"Today's Best Thing Ever article is brought to us by Dr. Charles Brabec. Thanks Charles!!\n\nWRAP - is it the Best Thing Ever?\n\nWell, no, no it's not. But it's pretty nice for what it does. So what does it do?\n\nWRAP is our campus-wide, web-based, single sign-on system. Users on any (Apache-based) web-server on campus can log in to WRAP, once, using their existing Unity ID and password, and they will be given a browser cookie that will identify them to other web-servers.\n\nWRAP is easy to configure: if your website is running on an existing OIT web-server, or many other servers on campus, WRAP may be already installed. You just need to setup an .htaccess file that looks very similar to BasicAuth:\n\nAuthType WRAP\nrequire affiliation ncsu.edu\nrequire user unityid1 unityid2 ...\n\nOnce configured, the Apache WRAP module automatically passes the authentication information to any scripts or pages that are running from the protected directory. PHP authors, for example, just need to look for the environment variable \"WRAP_USERID\" passed by the server, and the program can trust that is the current, authenticated, user.\n\nFolks who are setting up WRAP on their own servers will find it easy to install. We provide RHEL-based RPM packages for the current Apache modules. We also have source code which is pretty simple to build using standard libraries from Apache and OpenSSL. We offer a perl module as well. These downloads and some pages of documentation can be found at: <a href=\"https://webauth.ncsu.edu/wrap/\">https://webauth.ncsu.edu/wrap/</a> Note that we require users to register to download the software, but that registration is freely available to anyone with a Unity account.\n\nBy using WRAP, developers do not need to create their own login system. LDAPS is available, certainly. But that presents the users with \"yet another website asking for my password\". That - and good security practice - demands that your login system be SSL-enabled to protect the credentials on the wire between the browser and the servers. With WRAP, the users visit a single login page every time. That page is SSL-encrypted, so you don't have to worry about it as a developer. The cookie that WRAP uses is encrypted with 768-bit RSA, so it can be safely passed on a open connection.\n\nSo far so good, so what's wrong with WRAP? Why isn't it the Best Thing Ever?\n\n1) It only works on Apache servers. No IIS. No Java/Tomcat. OK, I take that last part back. The library has successfully written and deployed a Java-based WRAP module on their own servers. I'm no Java expert, so while I have a copy of their code I have never tried to use it, much less support it.\n\n2) It only works on ncsu.edu servers. The authentication token generated by WRAP is saved on the user's browser as a cookie. Standard cookie rules prevent passing that cookie, which is assigned to the ncsu.edu domain, to any server that does not have a name in our domain. A side effect of this that you may have run into: if you access your site by IP address, or by a shortened domain name like http://sysnews/, you will notice that WRAP will not work properly. The browser simply will not pass your cookie along.\n\n3) It doesn't play well with others. When it was first started, WRAP was written to use the same configuration options as BasicAuth. As a result, there is no way to tell Apache which \"require\" commands apply to WRAP, and which might apply to BasicAuth or something else. This becomes more of a problem because...\n\n4) It doesn't know about anyone who doesn't have a Unity ID. WRAP is great for Unity users. It's useless for guests. There's no easy way to extend the user-base.\n\n5) There is no way to handle idle-timeout. Once you login, you get a cookie that is good for the full time period that you requested (1 or 10 hours). If you walk away from a public computer, and do not destroy that cookie, then the next user has your credentials for the duration of the cookie.\n\n6) WRAP is an Authentication system: it tells you who the user is. It is not an Authorization system: it cannot tell you if the user has a permission, or is part of a group, or any other such attributes. The burden of determining which users have what permissions is still left to the code developer.\n\nWRAP sucks! What else have you got?\n\nShibboleth is coming down the pike. It's an open source SAML-based project that tries to solve a lot of these problems that are part of WRAP and common to other cookie-based SSO's. Specifically it improves upon these points:\n\n1) The Shibboleth service provider is available for Apache and IIS servers, and probably others.\n2) While it uses cookies, those cookies are specific to each client-server pair and do not need to be shared across domains\n3) Auth configuration is well separated from BasicAuth\n4) Your federation determines whose identity providers you can use. NCSU has three federation memberships, one for campus-only, one covering the entire UNC system of schools, and InCommon, which welcomes registration from almost any educational institution. We are also working with NC Trust, which is another state-wide collection of secondary schools and universities based in InCommon.\n5) It offers idle timeouts\n6) Shibboleth is an attribute-based system. By design, it sends information about the user without unnecessarily exposing the private identity of the user. In other words, it can tell your system that the user is a student at NC State, without giving you their name. It can also be configure to release few, some, or all attributes about a user per server that asks... so the same login can be used to visit iTunesU as an NC State student, and register for courses with the Student ID number.\n\nShibboleth is still in development on campus. We have a semi-production server <a href=\"https://shib.ncsu.edu/\">https://shib.ncsu.edu/</a> which is currently only seeing very light use. We are working on improving the horsepower to handle more traffic as new projects come on board. We are also still ironing out the details of our attribute release policies. Once these are done, we hope to open the service to general campus use, hopefully before the end of the year.\n\nHere's a sample of some current and future projects using Shibboleth:\n- VCL\n- UNC GA's cross-campus registration system\n- Engineering is working on a software deployment project for courses\n- Delta is working on Moodle\n- The campus portal project\n- Replace (or at least augment) WRAP as a general web-server authentication option\n- WebAssign already uses Shibboleth for other campuses\n- Google Apps / Gmail - can authenticate via SAML to a Shibboleth service\n\nLinks for more information:\n<a href=\"https://webauth.ncsu.edu/wrap/\" target=\"_blank\">https://webauth.ncsu.edu/wrap/</a>\n<a href=\"https://shib.ncsu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">https://shib.ncsu.edu/</a>","createdDate":"2009-08-04T12:44:29.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-09-10T19:19:47.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:8233","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"Ah!

I considered all the options. I consulted reviews, friends, my soul's reactions to TV commercials, and of course the all-knowing wikipedia (well maybe not). And after all of that, I still bought a Mac for my primary home machine. A nice shiny new 24\" iMac. I knew I'd have to change a few things as far as software choices, and I was worried about the impending hit to my wallet if I had to purchase Parallels. I know there are Mac alternatives to nearly any PC offering, but I recently found myself using a couple of programs that do not have a Mac version (yet). If you're an interested PC user, I'm referring mainly to <a href=\"http://www.artisteer.com\" target=\"_blank\">Artisteer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.digsby.com\" target=\"_blank\">Digsby</a>. Also, because my Mac will be used by other people less accustomed to the Apple way of doing things, I still needed a way to run Windows, as well as Windows programs.\n\nEnter....the wonderful, the magnificent, the totally awesomely free VirtualBox ( <a href=\"http://www.virtualbox.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.virtualbox.org</a> )\n\nFor the layperson, VirtualBox allows you to install multiple Virtual computers inside your existing operating system. For example, you could run Windows XP, Windows 2000, Ubuntu, SUSE and Fedora all at the same time in separate windows on your Mac. VirtualBox runs on Windows, Linux, Macintosh and OpenSolaris hosts and supports a whole bunch of operating systems....see here for the complete list: <a href=\"http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Guest_OSes\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Guest_OSes</a>\n\nThe process is extremely simple. Download from the website, install, run the wizard to configure the virtual machine, install the OS, done! You'll be able to configure every little setting if you choose to, or you can go with the defaults for how much RAM to dedicate, hard drive space etc. I usually choose the defaults, because i can always go back and change the settings if needed.

Whether it's WordPress or Drupal or just a simple site hanging out in HTML Land, it's not always easy to come up with a nice, possibly professional, certainly snazzy site design.\n\nNow before we begin we're all probably aware that it's possible to find site designs and ready-made themes out on the web, however there are plenty of concerns with going this route. Most of these collections contain themes done by different designers so the quality of the themes vary more than Michael Jackson's nose (too soon?). Most of these websites do offer users a place to provide comments or rate the themes that are included but ultimately one really needs to be prepared to put some effort into at least testing these themes before going into production. Some of the sites I'm sharing here have done a good job of trying to manage this issue, but others haven't bothered to address the problem at all, so be aware.\n\nOh, and FYI I'm ignoring the theme sites associated with products (i.e. the Themes page in Drupal.org; the free themes directory on WordPress.org) since they're pretty much your first hit every time and often are more for tutorials and troubleshooting than displaying theme options.\n\n\n<b>Drupal Themes</b>\n<a href=\"http://drupal2u.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://drupal2u.com/</a>\nThis site is a mix of the good, bad and ugly. On the plus side there are LOTS of themes here and unlike some other sites, it's all Drupal and all free. There's also a menu to jump to the category of designs you want, though I suggest considering the Drupal version (5.x, 6.x) category first. The bad is that there's no evaluation of the Drupal themes at all and also no larger preview or demo of the designs. And the \"ugly\" rears its head in the form of way too many ads that you have to scroll through before you can take a decent look at any of the themes.\n\n<b>WordPress Themes</b>\n<a href=\"http://www.themespreview.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.themespreview.com/</a>\nThis is a great site for a number of reasons. First of all you can search for themes based on the style, layout or appearance. They also offer support (a rare treat indeed) for any themes that they did and will facilitate contact with any other designers willing to take feedback or offer support. Finally, and best of all, they have a fantastic system for assigning points to their themes based on their XHTML and CSS W3C compliance, their compatibility with IE (6.0 or 7.0) and Firefox, their layout flexibility and other categories. And those designs that earn high scores are marked by a gold, silver or bronze seal that's easily identifiable.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.freethemelayouts.com/\">http://www.freethemelayouts.com/</a>\nThis site doesn't have a huge selection but all the designs are done by one group so there's less quality variation. These designs are a little more professional looking but still free and the site has a great pop-up preview of each design plus a full working demo.\n\n<b>Multi-platform Options</b>\n<a href=\"http://www.themza.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.themza.com</a>\nThese guys get a mention solely because they offer some decent, free Moodle themes, which are a little hard to come by. One of these with a few modifications might do good things for a NC State Moodle course at some point in the not too distant future... This site also has a handful of Joomla themes.\n\n<a href=\"http://themebot.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://themebot.com</a>\nIt's got an annoying advertise-y environment but there are free themes available for Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, XOOPS, PHPBB, Flash and some good, old-fashioned HTML. This site also lets you know up front how the theme/template validates, whether it's fixed width or fluid, if it's CSS or table-based and gives you a full-size demo. The designs are kind of hit or miss but there are enough options to give you something to work with if you put the time in to find it.\n\n<b>Design-only Sites</b>\n<a href=\"http://www.edustyle.net/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.edustyle.net/</a>\nMany of you have probably already found this site (I think it may have already been referenced on our Ning site somewhere...) but this is a good site to see what other schools are doing. And some schools are doing some really cool stuff. My favorite thing on this site is the \"Redesigned\" section in which you can compare Before and After shots of various sites. BTW, there are five NC State sites that have been submitted (there may be more, that's all I found); I'd love to see more but people are allowed to vote on your site (basically just plus or minus) so be aware of that going in...\n\n<a href=\"http://www.oswd.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.oswd.org/</a>\nThese are designs without a designated CMS so they are by nature a bit more flexible. This site kindly lets the user know if the design validates and also allows users to give it a rating so you have some idea of what you're getting into. There are a lot of simple, clean designs on here, some of which may look familiar to you and all of which are free, though they do have a \"premium\" section if you're shopping with a little money.\n\n---\n\nI'm sure there are other great sites out there so if you've got suggestions please post them! These kinds of things are always handy, even if it's just for inspiration or a jumping-off point.

One of the groups we do work for gives me a call and they are having a problem with an old, legacy-style app that they are using. The app is critical to their business practice, but nobody really supports it. It's been around for about 5 or 6 years, with minimal to no updates. And now it's broke, and they don't know why. So, here I go. I start trying to figure out the application, but the code is horrendous. No comments. Variables are named $myVar. Functions are called makeOutput(). There's one file with 50+ functions in it, and none of them documented. I think to myself, \"Who is the moron that wrote this garbage?\"....then I look at the ONE comment in the ONE include file. // Jason Austin - 2001. Crap. I'm the moron!\n\nIf you have been a programmer for more than 5 minutes, this has probably happened to you. You look back at old code and think \"What was I thinking when I did that?\". The good news is, that means that you have (hopefully) grown as a programmer. The bad news is that you still have to do something with this crappy code.\n\nTo try to \"future proof\" your code, there are some things current-you can do to help future-you not pull your hair out when looking at it. Perhaps the easiest and most productive thing to do is adopt a coding standard. Notice is said <b>ADOPT</b>...not <b>CREATE</b>. There are quite a few coding standards out there for whatever language you are working in, so there is absolutely no need for you to create your own. In fact, I would discourage it. Just use something that someone else has already put many hours of thought and reasoning into. This will be a big help when other people look at or edit your code.\n\nSo what do coding standards entail? Most of them have guidelines for the formatting of code, naming of variables and methods, naming of files, organization of code, etc. The goal is to make your code look no different than my code. That way when you go to edit something that I wrote, you can follow what is going on easily. One of the other main focuses of a coding standard is documentation. This is something that we all struggle with. It's just not something that comes naturally to programmers. Most of us are naive enough to think that when we come back to this code in 2 years, we will always remember what is going on. I'm here to tell you that that is 100% false. Documenting your code is essential to its long life, so like Nike, \"Just Do It\".\n\nTo better illustrate the difference between code with no adherence to a coding standard and code that does, let's look at an example:\n\n<code>&lt;?$my_var=array(1,2,3);\n$myOther_var=2;\nfor($i=0;$i\nfunction my_var($i,$l){ return str_pad($i,$l,'0',STR_PAD_LEFT); }\n?&gt;\n</code>\n\nOuch, my eyes hurt from just looking at that. What language is it? Looks like PHP, but I'm not sure. Could be perl... Why are there no spaces...anywhere??? What is $my_var and $myOther_Var representing? Why are we looping through them, and why is there a method and a variable called my_var? Now lets look at the same code, following the Zend Framework coding standards:\n\n\n<code>&lt;?php\n// Numbers from source\n$source = array(1, 2, 3);\n\n// length of return string\n$returnStringLength = 2;\n\n// Loop through source, echo result from padWithZero() method\nfor ($i = 0; $i &lt; count($source); $i++) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0echo padWithZero($source[$i], $returnStringLength);\n}\n\n/**\n* Pads a number on the left with 0's.\n* IE: padWithZero(2,4) would return '0002'\n*\n* @param $number Number to pad\n* @param $padLength length of the string to return\n* @return string padded with 0's\n*/\nfunction padWithZero($number, $padLength)\n{\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return str_pad($number, $padLength, '0', STR_PAD_LEFT);\n}\n\n</code>\nNow this makes much more sense. Now we see what the point of the code is, what the variables mean, and what the method does. Both pieces of code accomplish the same task, but example #2 is preferable. This example seems really simple to follow, and it is. But imagine if you had thousands of lines of the first example code? You'd be lost real quick. With a well documented, well formatted piece of code, you (or anyone else looking at your code) will be able to follow what is going on.\n\nSo if you haven't already, I would encourage you to adopt a coding standard for whatever language you are working in. PHP is working on a coding standard for the whole language, but for now you can adopt ones from PEAR or Zend. Adobe has coding standards for Cold Fusion. Google has an Objective-C style guide. My point is that every language has at least one, so find it and adopt it. Future-you will thank present-you.","createdDate":"2009-07-07T14:29:32.000Z","updatedDate":"2011-03-03T15:36:45.802Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:7806","contributorName":"3eskgaralqbpn","description":"Oh, no, no offense meant.

See, I made a chart that shows how everybody loves charts:\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><img src=\"http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=v&amp;chs=300x200&amp;chd=t:75,50,0,50,50,0,0&amp;chdl=Everyones+Love|Charts&amp;chtt=Everyones+Love+Of+Charts\"/></p>\n\nYou're probably asking yourself, \"Self, how was Jason able to ninja up some fly charts like that?\" Well, I'll tell you how...it's the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/chart/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Charts API</a>!\n\nIn it's no-doubt infinite wisdom, Google has come through yet again with a useful time saver. The Google Charts API lets you make all kinds of fun charts and graphs. Bar graphs, line graphs,Venn diagrams, crazy charts I've never heard of nor know what they mean...even barcodes and maps! The API also lets you add labels, gradients, grid lines, titles, legends. Anything you can think of needing in a chart or graph, Google hooks you up.\n\nNow if you have ever used a standard software graphing package, you may be thinking \"Yeah, great, but this is going to take me forever to figure out how to use it\". That's just wrong. In fact it is so wrong, that I made a chart to tell you how wrong you are:\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><img src=\"http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=200x100&amp;cht=gom&amp;chd=t:12&amp;chtt=Scale+of+Wrongness&amp;chl=You\"/></p>\n\nIt's as easy as making a URL. All you have to do is know Google's black-magic ways and poof! You have a chart that does exactly what you want! And Google is nice enough to lay all the directions and documentation out at the Google Chart API site. Want to know how any of the charts seen here are created? Just right click on the image and click \"View Image\". This will show you the URL that was created to form the chart.\n\nSo the next time you think to yourself, \"Self, a chart would be awesome right here!\", you can just call up your old buddy Google Charts, and BAM! You'll be showing people how awesome your charting skillz are. And on that note, I leave you with this link: <a href=\"http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&amp;chs=500x200&amp;chd=s:Hellob&amp;chdl=give+you+up|let+you+down|run+around+and+desert+you|make+you+cry|say+goodbye|tell+a+lie+and+hurt+you&amp;chco=CC0000|00CC00|0000CC|CCCC00|CC00CC|00CCCC&amp;chtt=Rick+Rolled+Chart+Style|Rick+Astley+Would+Never...\" target=\"_blank\">Most Awesome Google Chart EVAR!</a>\n\nSo a challenge is now being made to all of you who have read this article.

We could have done it in PHP, but due to the nature of where the links were that I wanted to manage, it would have been more hassle then it was worth to shoehorn PHP code into. Javascript was just an easier fix.\n2. It's understood about Javascript not being a really secure fix to this issue. Actually this all started from an internal conversation with us wondering if \"could you do something like this\". So this would be more of a casual \"security by obscurity\" kind of thing. Even if someone took the time to look deep into the code the back end is secured down pretty well even if someone found the link.\n3. The WRAP options are definitely worth exploring. Didn't know it could work like that!\n4.

Here's where a few good font resources would come in handy.....\n\n<b><a href=\"http://dafont.com\">dafont.com</a></b>\n\nThere are probably hundreds of font sites out there but I keep coming back to this one-- <a href=\"http://dafont.com\">dafont.com</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://dafont.com\">dafont.com</a> is nicely organized into clear, if somewhat subjective categories: fancy, foreign-look, techno, gothic, basic, script, holiday and a huge selection of dingbats. They're also sub-categorized but no matter how desperate I am to fill space I will not copy those lists here.\n\nThe really nice thing is that while the categories might help if you're not sure what you're looking for, you can still use the search tool to hunt down something specific. And all searches also give you a list of commercial fonts from other sites that might meet your description. Of course, those fonts typically cost at least $35, while all fonts on dafont are free. Makes me happy just to say it so I'm gonna say it again: <b>FREE.</b>\n\nIf in your searches you find a great font but aren't sure if it will work for your purposes, test it out! Each font has an area where you can type in the text you want to use, select a font size (tiny, small, medium, large) and then preview. Very handy for finding out what works and what doesn't before you download.\n\nSo the next time you're looking for a nice touch on a banner or a symbol that you just can't find in Photoshop remember your fonts and go browse dafont.

You want to offer as many possible meeting times and dates as possible to increase the odds of finding an available time and date that accommodates the greatest number of people.\n\nForget collecting all those email responses. Forget that little piece of paper (or spreadsheet!) tallying all of the dates and times. Forget collating the yeses to see which date has the most response.\n\nJust do it all on <a href=\"http://doodle.com/\">doodle.com</a>, which has a very intuitive interface. I walked through my first schedule creation without incident.\n\nThe three-step approach to create a schedule:\n\n<b>Step 1</b> \u2013 Enter title and description of the event, and enter your name and (optionally your email address). I usually include these two sentences in the description, since no directions appear when the user comes to fill out the poll:\n\n\"Select the check box under the dates/times you can make. Leave the check box clear under the dates/times you can't.\"\n\n<b>Step 2</b> \u2013 Select the dates that you\u2019d like to include as potential days for the event. This is done through a nice calendar interface. Just click on the dates on the calendar that you\u2019d like to include as options.\n\n<b>Step 3</b> \u2013 Select the time or times you\u2019d like to offer up as options. Five different time entry slots are provided, but you can always click to add more. I use military time, but it takes other formats as well. (Examples are given.)\n\nThen you click <i>Options</i> (I just take all the defaults on this page), and then <i>Finish</i>. It gives you two URLs: one for the participants, which is what you send to the people you're inviting to your event, and the other for you as the administrator to go back and make any changes.\n\nAnd in the end, you get a very nice visual representation of the date/time available for everyone who participated in the poll. Just like <a href=\"http://www.doodle.com/hkhga7eitp2b7p9q\">the one for our Habitat For Humanity event</a>.

Following the principles of an unconference, we will leverage the wisdom of the crowd in an open environment where everyone\u2019s participation is encouraged.\n\nIn addition to those attending in person, we will be using Adobe Connect to stream the event live and allow our virtual attendees to participate in the proceedings. The URL for the summit is <a href=\"http://breeze.psu.edu/psuwebsms\">http://breeze.psu.edu/psuwebsms</a>. (Please note the login will be required during the summit.)\n\nWe will also be utilizing social media to create a backchannel to let people from across the globe participate virtually. For those of you who want to participate on Twitter, delicious, Flickr, etc., the hashtag for the event is #smsummit\n\nDiscussion topics will be chosen by participants. To facilitate conversation both before and after the summit, I have created the following group on our site: <a href=\"http://cuwebd.ning.com/group/socialmediasummit\">http://cuwebd.ning.com/group/socialmediasummit</a> . I have started the conversation with a couple of potential topics for the summit.

Want to contribute to a worthwhile project but wondered where your money was going? Do you like to have a little more stake in what your money is being used for? Do you get the overwhelming feeling that your small gift doesn't really help any individual in particular? Enter...<a href=\"http://www.kiva.org\">Kiva.org</a>...loans that change lives.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.kiva.org\">Kiva.org</a> is a microfinance organization. Simply put, Kiva allows individuals to make small loans to people all over the globe. You can make a loan as small as $25, or as large as the amount being asked for.\n\n<b>Here's the way it works:</b>\n\n1. A person or group has a project that needs funding, so Kiva and a local agency help that person get their project posted to kiva.org\n2. Many people make loans to that project until it is fully funded\n3. The loan funding is dispersed to the project owner\n4. They make payments back to you over the course of the loan period.\n\nHere's some of the reasons I really like Kiva (other than the feeling of actually making a difference in an individual's life):\n\n<b>1. You can lend as part of a team</b>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/62-kiva_team_page.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/63-kiva_team_page.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"209\"/></a></p>\n\nI have setup the NCSU Web Developer's team on Kiva, so if anyone wants to join, please do: <a href=\"http://www.kiva.org/team/ncsuwebdev\">http://www.kiva.org/team/ncsuwebdev</a>. Teams can more easily meet the asking amounts of certain projects, and therefore more quickly help a project get off the ground. Maybe there are projects on Kiva that suit our web developer's community, like <a href=\"http://www.kiva.org/app.php?page=businesses&amp;action=about&amp;id=105142\">Internet Cafes</a> or other web related businesses.\n\n<b>2. Get your research &amp; statistics fix:</b>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/64-kiva_stats.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/65-kiva_stats.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"147\"/></a></p>\n\nYou can research the risk factors for loaning to different parts of the world. For example, you can choose whether to loan based on a star rating system, or amount of delinquent loans, or number of loans defaulted.\n\n<b>3. Kiva.org is built on Zend Framework</b>\nWell...not really a good reason, but it's interesting to know.\n\n<b>4. You get paid back or you can re-invest.</b>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/66-kiva_stats2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/67-kiva_stats2.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"138\"/></a></p>\n\nYou don't earn interest on your loans, so don't expect to be making money off Mr Azizov in Tajikistan who farms livestock. I like the idea of being able to pull my money out, if i ever get into a situation where i need some funds. With Kiva, loan payments made by the project owners are put into my Kiva account. I can either choose to re-lend the money to another project, or withdraw it into my own bank account. I am yet to withdraw anything yet, so i can't tell you about that process with any individual experience.\n\nSo check out Kiva when you get a chance. Kiva is also on twitter (<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/kiva\">@kiva</a>) and there's a <a href=\"http://kiva.ourtoolbar.com/\">firefox toolbar</a> that lets you keep a trained eye on your loans...if you like having a little closer look at how your money is doing.\n\nI've been using Kiva since April 9th, 2008, and have since <a href=\"http://www.kiva.org/lender/usaussie\">made 15 loans</a>. I expect to make many more, and hope that those of you who may be able to, join the NCSU Web Developer's team on Kiva with me.","createdDate":"2009-06-02T12:05:46.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-06-02T12:15:06.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!"},{"id":"2486881:Topic:6808","contributorName":"2vklsif9jjgh1","title":"Free WAP/WML emulators","description":"Hi Folks,\n\nI was looking for a free WAP/WML emulator for Windows XP a couple weeks ago to demo the mobile web interface for <a href=\"http://gwweb.ncsu.edu\">http://gwweb.ncsu.edu</a>.

Do nothing (No effort)\nMobile technology is getting better and will eventually offer a similar experience as you'd get on a desktop. Besides, mobile visitors are used to their devices rendering screen-based webpages in a different format. The websites that Robert pointed to are supporting this approach (let the technology catch up).\n\n2. Use a mobile stylesheet (A little effort)\nCreate a mobile-specific stylesheet that is activated on mobile devices. You can make the experience a little more friendly for those visitors by making link targets bigger and reducing the amount of small text.\n\n3. Sign up for a mobile transcoding service (A little effort + money)\nAn increasingly popular option. The service automatically creates a stripped-down version of your website and a few key content sections (you don't have to maintain it separately). One advantage is that data presented is optimized for specific devices (they use device detection). A popular service is Usablenet Mobile (<a href=\"http://www.usablenet.com/usablenet_mobile.html\">http://www.usablenet.com/usablenet_mobile.html</a>).\n\n4. Create an independent mobile version of your website (A lot of effort)\nIt is very important to consider the geographical context of mobile users. The things they do and the functionality they need is dependent on where they are, not necessarily who they are. A student on campus may be wondering where the nearest computer lab is or what the bus schedule looks like. Visitors may want to know what events are going on, where they can eat, and how they can get from one point to another. Essentially, you create a mental model that is completely independent of what you used to build your homepage, and then go from there. Obviously, there's a substantial effort behind this approach, but it's the best if you want to create a rewarding and motivating mobile experience.\n\nIn case you're wondering, my university is currently using approach #2, but is looking to shift toward approach #3 or #4 in the next year or so.\n\n\nAlso see:\n<a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/return-of-the-mobile-stylesheet\">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/return-of-the-mobile-stylesheet</a>","createdDate":"2009-05-28T11:29:17.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-07-16T20:47:57.000Z","approved":"Y","groupId":"2486881:Group:2651","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:7865","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"#1 is probably the best plan in the sense that if you can design it using standards, the mobile devices will be able to interpret it in the way that makes the most sense.\n\n#2 has the advantage of trying to cut down on the \"they've got a huge screen to enjoy my artwork on\" mindset, and appears to be targeted on <a href=\"http://delta.ncsu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">the DELTA website</a> with the media=\"handheld\" option. The guy who wrote it is gone now, but it probably worked back then. The problem that you run into is that once you are unable to test on a platform, that platform's support can degrade.

There are millions of people on there, and there is always something interesting to read or look at. Perhaps one of the best benefits of twitter is its ability to reach out to an audience you normally wouldn't be able to reach out to. Because of this, lots of blogging software packages have integrating the ability to post to twitter when you create a new blog post. But what if your blogging software doesn't support that? Well, that is why <a href=\"http://www.twitterfeed.com\">twitterfeed</a> may be the best thing ever.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"discussions/68-twitterfeed.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"120\"/></p>\n\ntwitterfeed allows you to take a simple RSS feed from any site and post it to your twitter account as a tweet. twitterfeed checks the RSS feed on a periodic basis (from once a day to once every 30 minutes) and posts anything new that shows up on the feed. So now, as long as your blog or message board or whatever supports RSS feeds, you can post updates to twitter automatically.\n\nSignup is easy. All you need to do is authenticate with your OpenID (if you don't know what OpenID is, check out <a href=\"http://ncsuwebdev.ning.com/forum/topics/best-thing-ever-openid\">last week's Best Thing Ever</a>). Once authenticated, you can setup any number of feeds to go to any number of twitter accounts. All you need to do is authenticate with your desired account through twitter (don't worry, twitterfeed never keeps your twitter username and password because they use OAuth to authenticate you. You will be seeing a Best Thing Ever on Oauth soon ;). Once you have authenticated to twitter, you tell twitterfeed what RSS feed to read, how often to check it, and what info to put in the tweet. It is that easy!\n\nIn case you were wondering, twitterfeed powers our <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ncsuwebdev\">@ncsuwebdev</a> bot that posts new events, forum postings, and blog posts.\n\nSo if you use any sites like blogger.com or livejournal.com, checkout twitterfeed to automatically share your blog posts with your twitter friends!","createdDate":"2009-05-26T13:12:14.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-06-02T16:42:02.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:6857","contributorName":"3p7bzgj31hmap","description":"Something like this is especially useful for an organization or some kind of news source.

Got some bad news on the iPhone license. Bill Coker, our University Software Licensing guru has been working on this for us for a while and it doesn't appear to be possible. I asked him to write up his findings so that I could post them accurately. Here they are:\n\n======\n\nIt was the goal of the Office of Information Technology to establish an iPhone Developers Program with Apple. After having separate discussions with Apple and our attorney, OIT has determined that it can no longer pursue this program. Apple is making the process far too difficult for a state supported higher education institution to join.\n\nApple has two requirements for an institution to enter the program. First, the individual who enrolls the university into this program must a) be an iPhone Developer who can sponsor the university and b) have legal binding authority on behalf of the university. Even if we were able to find someone who could meet these requirements, the university does not permit an individual to accept personal liability on behalf of the university.\n\nFurther, Apple has indicated that the Agreement is \u201cas-is\u201d and that even if we are able to cite North Carolina statutes that prevent us from accepting certain terms, there is still the excellent chance that Apple will refuse our requests for modifications. We were told by the manager of the iPhone Development Program that they have never seen Apple modify terms under these circumstances. The university will not and cannot be asked to sign anything that is viewed by North Carolina law as illegal, and based upon our discussions, we feel the opportunity to successfully enter into this program is minimal. We have looked to see if other public higher education institutions in North Carolina have been able to join this program, but we have discovered none.\n\nWe also asked whether other groups on campus can enter into the program on behalf of their college, division or department. We were told that this was not permitted and the agreement would have to be completed on the university level.\n\n=====\n\nSo it looks like we are out of luck with developing anything for native iPhone apps. I am actively trying to find ways around this, so if anyone has any ideas, I would be more than happy to entertain them.","createdDate":"2009-10-15T15:09:46.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:7230","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","description":"Let me be clear that OIT is not brokering this on behalf of OIT.

After all if you only have one \"account key\", who is the \"owner\" of the account? If it is set up in this way, then all the revenue may end up in OIT's hands instead of the department who posted the non-free app. Then again, it may be that you can have an unlimited number of accounts even though you only have the one developer license. Of course they could always have multiple developer licenses for the University, but I have no idea how they would generate them or if it would just be a pool that gets handed out.\n\nThanks Jason for keeping us updated.

Since I finally found one, I figured I'd share it...\n\nThe problem:\n\nSay you have a Drupal site, and that site has content that is not public. The Drupal engine only displays the articles that are available to you as an authenticated user. This includes the built-in RSS syndication tools. You can download and preview an RSS feed as an authenticated user, but the feed that you will get from a standard reader that is not authenticated will be missing most of the content.\n\nThe solution:\n\n<a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/tokenauth\">Token Authentication</a> - a drupal module that lets you add a unique, secret token to any drupal URL, and the Drupal engine will render the content as if the token's owner is the authenticated user.\n\nUsage:\n* As the site administrator, download, install, and enable the Token Authentication module.\n* You can configure a few settings for the module, like token length and which pages are permitted to have token access. By default, the module is configured to allow token access only on RSS/feed pages.\n* Remember to visit your permissions page and grant tokenauth access to your registered users.\n\nAs a user:\n* Login to the site, and go to your My Account page.\n* Click on the \"Token authentication\" tab.\n* The module will present you with your unique token, some basic usage instructions, and two example links: one for the front page feed, and the other for the blog posts feed.\n* If you just want the front page feed, you can easily right click the example link and \"copy link location\" and then paste the URL into your favorite RSS reader.\n\nWarnings:\n\nThis module exposes content that is meant to have limited access.

It seems that every site I visit these days, I need to make a new account and provide my name and email and a password. It's becoming a pain to keep up with where I have accounts, and what those accounts are, and then what the passwords to those accounts are. That's why OpenID may quite possibly be the best thing ever.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"discussions/69-openid.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"253\" height=\"71\"/></p>\n\nOpenID \"eliminates the need for multiple usernames across different websites, simplifying your online experience.\" Basically, it is a single-signon tool that anyone can implement. You have one OpenID and one password, and you can use that username/password for a multitude of sites that support signon with OpenID.\n\nSo how exactly does that work? The first thing you have to do is create an OpenID with a provider. Some services, such as wordpress.com, blogger.com and flickr.com, provide you with an OpenID already. All you have to do is know where to look and how to access it. If you want to have a more generic OpenID that is not affiliated with one of those services, you can register with a host of other providers. My personal OpenID is registered with <a href=\"www.MyOpenId.com\">MyOpenId.com</a> and it has worked out really well.\n\nOnce you have registered your OpenID, you are ready to go. When you visit a site that supports authentication with OpenID, you will enter in your OpenID (which usually looks like a URL). You will get redirected to your provider's website where you will enter in your OpenID password. Once you authenticate, you will get sent back to the application and you are now authenticated! No need to create a new account, with a new username and password. Everything is handled by OpenID.\n\nFor us developers, this is a really intriguing option. No more messing with account provisioning! No more storage and retrieval of passwords! And implementation is pretty easy. Most PHP frameworks have built-in support for OpenID (I know CakePHP and Zend Framework do), so integration into existing applications is a snap.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about OpenID, check out <a href=\"http://www.openid.net\">http://www.openid.net</a>.","createdDate":"2009-05-19T12:48:10.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-05-19T12:48:21.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!"},{"id":"2486881:Topic:6405","contributorName":"1x58sgozterf4","title":"The NC State Branding Bar","description":"University Communication (Public Affairs) at NC State has been tasked with developing a brand book for the university in an effort to improve consistency in communications and marketing. As part of this process, Web Communication has been tasked with finalizing and delivering the NC State Branding Bar (what is commonly called the \u201cstrip\u201d) that will be included as part of the resulting university web requirements and guidelines.\n\nTo help us finalize the first iteration of the \u201cstrip\u201d we\u2019re offering a few versions to the university web developers first for testing and feedback. Currently, we have a very slimmed-down version of the strip, consisting of the NC State brick and a search box, as well as a version of the strip that includes a handful of university-wide \u201cutility\u201d links. We\u2019re interested in your feedback regarding which version you feel is most appropriate for this university-wide strip. Bear in mind that, in the interest of consistency, any links included in the strip would not be optional, edited or expandable outside of approved university-wide changes. (For instance, a department or unit could not add its own collection of links, remove unwanted links, change the wording of links, or change the destination of the links).\n\nAlso, what we\u2019re hoping to deliver in the near future is simply the first iteration of the strip. The hope is that eventually, we will be able to identify a manageable solution that allows the strip itself to be maintained centrally, so any changes, modifications or adjustments could be pushed out across the board.\n\nThat said, take it for a spin and let us know what you think.

Exactly why this group is so important. I\u2019ll do my best to answer some of the questions contained in the feedback. Keep in mind this is just me answering questions, and specifics can and probably will change.\n\nFirst, the questions of authority and enforcement. University Communications ( Public Affairs\u2026 the name change is official July 1) was commissioned to create the Brand Book in response to the PACE(President\u2019s Advisory committee on Efficiency and Effectiveness) on Marketing, Communications, and Public Relations activities at NC State for the purpose of making recommendations for increased effectiveness and efficiency. This study was done at the request of the UNC System President. That study produced several recommendations, many of which the Chancellor approved and asked be implemented. Among those was recommendation #10 \u201cCodify authority for visual identity in university policy.\u201d University Communications, as the central marketing, communications and public relations unit on campus, was charged with this task, which falls neatly within the work we\u2019ve been doing for the past two years with the marketing and awareness campaign (Red Means Go).\n\nAs for enforcement, we\u2019re working on a PRR (the regulation one) to answer those questions. That will, as all do, go through EO\u2019s and University Council and should provide clarity.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting again that the concept of the Branding Strip was approved during the NCSU redesign process by the university\u2019s Executive Officers.\n\nThat said, the goal here is to provide in early June, a publicly available branding strip as the first step toward providing some consistency across university web sites. We\u2019re working toward that \u201csilver bullet\u201d solution, but the intricacies of the university\u2019s web presence make this a pretty significant undertaking. As such, we\u2019re working now with a few options to get people comfortable with the concept. At this point, I think we\u2019ll offer an iFrame, javascript and HTML download version of the strip. Possibly a PHP and/or ASP include as well, until we can work out a single centrally managed solution.\n\nOne of the reasons we\u2019re after a central solution is this question of specific links in the bar. We\u2019ve already removed news, calendar and giving from the strip, realizing that those are problematic for a significant number of sites. The remaining links, we think, do a decent job of pointing to university resources and offering visitors, both new and repeat, and easy way to get to those things. It\u2019s obvious that not every site will reap a huge benefit by having the \u201cMyPack Portal\u201d or \u201cLibraries\u201d or \u201cCampus Map\u201d or \u201cCampus Directory\u201d or \u201cSearch\u201d but it seems like the inclusion of those links won\u2019t cause massive usability issues or significant conflict inside a site the same way news and calendar would have. If we can identify a central solution or set of solutions, we\u2019ll be able to adjust the links in the strip as push them out if we find that something is particularly problematic.\n\nColors: The university\u2019s official colors are red, white and black. Those are the colors the strip will be available in. That\u2019s it. No other colors, no freedom to change the colors, etc. The gray option that was available earlier will not be part of the public release, nor will it be included in the Brand Book as an accepted version. There will be a black type on white background option that isn\u2019t represented currently.\n\nThe search feature (toggle with radio button for local global) is customizable as part of the configuration for the iframe version.\n\nWidth is customizable; we just didn\u2019t detail it in this test release. No worries there.\n\nWe\u2019ll make the strip validate before it\u2019s public.\n\nAs for placement in the code, not really concerned with that at this point. It can go where it needs to go for now, as long as it appears, visually, at the top of the page. This does work against the consistency concept in some ways, but like I mentioned already, this is the first iteration, and we\u2019ll be fine tuning things in months to come. I\u2019d be interested in more discussion about this particular topic in regards to SEO, as the association with NCSU undoubtedly adds credibility to any content contained within a page (though I do realize the drawbacks, which is why we\u2019re not pursuing anything other than visual placement for the time being). The H1 tag, also, isn\u2019t particular problematic I don\u2019t think, but something worth discussing also. Great topic for discussion.\n\nSo what\u2019s next? The first edition of the Brand Book will be available in early June, as approved, reviewed, etc. by the Brand Advisory committee. The web portion will be detailed therein, as well as contained on a as-yet-to-be-launched website that will also house some \u201cbest practice\u201d recommendations (not requirements, just recommendations.\u201d That particular part will benefit from the expertise contained in this group, and we\u2019d love to have you all sending suggestions, examples, writeups, etc. for that portion of the site. It will also link to here (NING).\n\nThe other web-specific requirements stated in the Brand Book will include things like the official university color palette, approved HTML fonts and some minor content requirements. Nothing too dramatic. The goal is to encourage designers and developers to attempt some level of consistency and bear in mind that everything needs to represent NC State in a clear, consistent, professional way.\n\nHope this helps.

As long as you provide an alternative where a user using a screen reader can get an equivalent experience (IE access to the information), there is no problem.\n\nI'm not married to the idea.

I'm wondering what kind of arguments you'll receive semantically against making North Carolina State University the 'h1' across all pages, and placing it at the top of the source code.\n\nTypically, we place the branding bar code at the very bottom of the source code for the page (and use CSS to bring it to the top) because it's typically the least relevant content for the user once they've arrived at our location. We also want search engines to discover 'our' content before anything else, so order in the source code is important.\n\nWe typically also consider 'North Carolina State University' a second level heading (&lt;h2&gt;).\nAn example page structure might be:\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Department of Operations Research&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Admissions &lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Sub Topic A &lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Sub Topic B &lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;North Carolina State University&lt;/h2&gt;\n\nSee: <a href=\"http://www.eos.ncsu.edu/soc/\">http://www.eos.ncsu.edu/soc/</a> for a live example.\n\n2. You'll want to consider prepending some sort of string to your class names and id's in the source code. A class name like 'logo' is sure to conflict with a user's local css.\n\n3. If you're going to serve out these branding bars and images from a central location (which is the goal of an iframe), consider how many hits/bandwith you'll be dealing with.... essentially every single webpage that exists within the university will be pinging your files (scary thought). Right now, the branding bar uses 1 JS file, 1 CSS file and 5 images... there's 7 HTTP Requests (cache ignored).\n\n4. The iframe code generated by your tool does not validate...\n<a href=\"http://validator.w3.org/check?verbose=1&amp;uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.itecs.ncsu.edu%2Fbrandingbar.php\">http://validator.w3.org/check?verbose=1&amp;uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.it...</a>\n\n5. For some of these more common links like 'Directory', it may be better to say 'Campus Directory'.\n\n6. I firmly believe that users should have the freedom to integrate 'Search' into their design in different ways. Some projects will require that 'Search' be a much more prominent feature. Other sites may not want to leverage an engine like Google, they may want to search their own backend database/CMS. Also the link for search reads 'Search NCSU', but after clicking the link you realize you also have the option to 'Search This Site'.\n\n6b. For search, the magnifying glass and the red 'x' buttons are equally weighted in the overall visual heirarchy. However, one is clearly a primary action and the other is a secondary action... should they be equal?\n\n6c. The two search buttons and the NC State University brick could be combined into one image sprite to optimize load time. The 'white lines' don't really require an additional graphic, you could just use css' border-left. The background-image used on the search input box could probably also get cut.\n\n7. How do you intend to punish sites which don't comply with using the 'strip'?","createdDate":"2009-05-14T13:29:34.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:6460","contributorName":"36mexpty3zftm","description":"I agree that the Javascript solution is the right way to go.

Also, I've never seen a page jump around from an onload event and we use them all the time, but I'm sure it could happen if there was network lag or whatever. I honestly don't see how people function on the web with javascript disabled, or really why you would think it improves your experience to do that.\n\nMy point is that it gets you more than you give away: one version of the truth. If you distribute HTML code with all those links hardcoded in, you are stuck with those. That means if you want to make a change to what those links are, you have to touch every single webpage that implements those. Inevitably, you are going to have things out of date all over the place with people unwilling (or unavailable) to make the needed changes to stay in compliance.\n\nI'm not saying the JS idea is the only way to go. Only that part of the consideration has to be future-proofing as much as possible. Heck, you could embed a flash object too. The point is, centralizing this stuff makes more sense than distributing the HTML, and if I were going to do that, Javascript &gt; Flash &gt; other things I can't think of.\n\nIf you went the JS route and people have JS disabled, put in a [noscript] tag that points you to ncsu.edu and you're done.","createdDate":"2009-05-14T13:08:31.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:6447","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"We should treat JavaScript like the Premium Subscription to a service in the sense that if people don't have JavaScript, they still get all of the basic functionality, just not all the silly toys.

A single, centrally managed include file that injects into the DOM all the \"pieces\" of the branding bar, into whatever target is specified. That javascript file would load the CSS as well, so as a developer, your job is simple. Include a JS file, set some configuration options, and boom...your bar is there.\n\nThis gets you a lot of benefit like:\n- Change one of the links in one place, it gets propogated throughout every site that implements the bar.\n- Developer ease-of-use. You include a single JS file, and call an initialize method when the page loads with configuration options.\n- No-one mucking with the links on the bar. You give people HTML, they are going to mess with it. Inject it into the DOM and it's a bit harder for people to mess around with stuff.\n- Emergency Notifications. If there is an emergency on campus, it would be super simple to replace the nav bar with an alert that is big, flashy, and gets your attention. Having it centrally located would allow you to do that.\n\nJust a quick idea of implementation, here's what it would look like:\n[script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://someurl.ncsu.edu/navbar.js\"][/script]\n[script]\nvar options = new Array();\noptions['color'] = 'red';\noptions['align'] = 'left';\noptions['sitename'] = 'My Site Name';\noptions['googlesearch'] = true;\noptions['target'] = 'myContainerDiv';\n\nfunction init() {\nshowNcsuNavBar(options);\n}\n\nwindow.onload = init;\n[/script]\n\nClearly define the options and the implementation, then it doesn't matter what kind of site people are running (PHP, Cold Fusion, ASP, static HTML), they can implement this and it is the same for all users.\n\nRight quick, there are some cons:\n- Centrally managed means a single point of failure. But if you put it on <a href=\"http://www.ncsu.edu\">www.ncsu.edu</a> and it goes down, there are bigger problems.\n- JS compatibility with browsers. You'd just have to make sure it all works in a variety of browsers, including (gasp) ie6\n\nAnyway, that is my $0.02 worth. I think the idea of a branding bar has lots of merit.

The design developed by Web Communication is simple and unassuming. Varying the colors makes it flexible enough to use with most local color palettes (though I\u2019m curious why there\u2019s no \u201csearch box only\u201d bar in gray.)\n\nNix the strip with logo and search box entirely or change the box back to \u201cSearch NCSU\u201d text. At the college and departmental levels we\u2019re going to want to put a local search box in about the same horizontal position under the strip. I\u2019m concerned that two search boxes will be confusing and since your Google search doesn\u2019t index pages in all subdomains we have little choice but to offer a local one. I like what you did with the \u201cSearch NCSU\u201d text link on the other strip; the radio button choice of \u201cNCSU\u201d or \u201cYour Site\u201d works nicely provided we could personalize the \u201cYour Site\u201d text. Hey, we\u2019re the autobahn of innovation! Let\u2019s figure out a way to make the search box smart enough to figure out the name of the subdomain it\u2019s on.\n\nNext the strip with \u201cutility\u201d links:\n\n--Thanks for making the directory say \u201cDirectory\u201d!

A good portion of our faculty and staff do not understand that they need to change their listing here as well as in the MyPack Portal. Isn\u2019t it time we single-sourced contact info? Icing would be an API that all developers on campus can use.\n\n--Sentimentally I agree with Charlie that \u201cLibraries\u201d should stay, but trends at other big tech schools disagree. Only one of the US News top ten in engineering has libraries on their equivalent of our utility bar and that one looks like they copied their bar from ours.\n\n--I also agree with Charlie on dumping \u201cNews\u201d, \u201cCalendar\u201d and \u201cGiving\u201d.

With that said.... here's a couple of thoughts, with varying degrees of difficulty...\n\n1. Why Libraries? I'm assuming political....but to me, a more appropriate replacement would be either Academic Programs or some general link to academics at ncsu. Also, i think it would be more appropriate to have News and/or Calendar/Events.\n\n2. I think you should have several centered options, based on standard widths. Right now, it looks like the centered version is based on a 600px wide layout, which would make it look just fine. I don't think it looks as good when you use it in a 750, 950 or 974px layout. It just looks kind of crunched together. I don't have an exact solution just yet, but if you look at it on a larger display, when combined with a site template underneath it, it appears very scrunched together.\n\n3. I think that rather than provide the HTML directly to people to use (and abuse), you could provide methods for them to include a centrally managed strip. IE: provide strips for each common languages used on campus. IFrames can work for the HTML pages people create, but a simple PHP/CF/Perl/other 'include' code snippet would be useful i think. This way, if (and when) the strip has links added or removed, you can do it at a university level, rather than having to wait several months for each web developer to update their own pages and templates (like you're going to have to wait during this current re-branding exercise).\n\n4. I'm not sure of the purpose of the search box only version. I think if you are going for consistency, you would attempt 100% consistency, rather than two versions. I think when people see the strip at the top, they will expect to see the utility links on the bar. If you allow people to just use a search box only with the brick, i think that detracts from the original purpose of providing brand and site consistency.\n\nMy $0.02.","createdDate":"2009-05-13T16:54:19.000Z"}]},{"id":"2486881:Topic:6381","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","title":"Requirements for a system to share code/projects/etc.","description":"In case you missed the other thread, I have registered code.ncsu.edu and started trying to find a way to make it benefit all of us by giving a central resource to share projects and code.\n\nWhen the webdev group first met last November, there was a lot of interest in figuring out a way to share stuff across units and departments. Subversion with WebSVN was mentioned, as well as a simple database of what is out there, who did it, etc. In researching some code hosting places, I have found some cool tools that will let us do alot, but my requirements may not match what everyone else wants, so I pose the question here: What would the requirements for a code/project sharing system be?\n\nTo get us started, here is what my initial requirements list was:\n\n- Multiple project support (with account provisioning based on the project)\n- Searchable\n- Repository access, specifically SVN\n- Able to manage code releases\n- Source for some documentation about installation, project requirements, etc.\n- Issue tracking. If you are sharing your project with other people, you need to be able to get feedback on it\n- Collaborative/Community approach\n- Open source and FREE!\n- Something that can be hosted on campus\n\nNow this approach was geared towards developers and not really towards \"end users\". In my mind, it would become part of our workflow, and a way to allow other folks to \"watch\" our projects to contribute if they'd like. End-users would be able to go to the page and search for things they care about, and download them as well, but it wouldn't be as much about PR as it would about functionality.\n\nIs this the right path?

That's right folks, it is free.\n\n<p style=\"float: right;\"><img src=\"discussions/71-331592803.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"/></p>\n\nBarCampRDU isn't your typical conference. There is no set schedule. There is no call for proposals, or scheduled speakers. It is an Un-conference conference. If you aren't familiar with un-conferences, it basically means there is a big white board that has slots available, and at the beginning of the day, it is empty. Everyone (and yeah, I mean everyone) pitches ideas for talks, and they get scheduled on the board. From the BarCampRDU website, \"<i>everyone is expected to teach, to talk, to participate</i>\". What happens is an intense learning experience where everyone is involved. It is less lecture, more collaboration, which is right down my alley :)\n\nSo if you aren't busy that weekend, you should really check out BarCampRDU. It is an opportunity to get some free training, network with people and companies, and have a good time with your fellow techies. And it may be the only chance to go to a conference this year for us State Employees.\n\nTo sign up, head over to our EventBrite page at <a href=\"http://barcamprdu2009.eventbrite.com/\">http://barcamprdu2009.eventbrite.com/</a>. The original allotment of tickets sold out, but we opened up another 50, so be sure to select the ticket type \"BarCamp RDU - additional space\".

I don\u2019t know if I can say that <a href=\"http://www.airtightinteractive.com/simpleviewer/\">SimpleViewer</a> galleries from Airtight Interactive are \u201cthe best (photo display) thing ever\u201d, but I can say that it has been quite useful and a fan favorite of folks over here in the College of Natural Resources.\n\nThis all started, simply enough, with a request I get a lot, namely: \u201cHow do I post my cool pictures on the Web, web guy?\u201d To which I used to respond: \u201cUhhh, well, there a few different ways to do this..\u201d No longer is that my reply. I have found a solution which satisfies a few criteria as far as a recommendable method. Those criteria are as follows:\n\n1. Has to be something that non-Web people can do\n2. Has to be small in file size\n3. The less complex the better\n4. Must be low on the server-side technical requirements\n5. Must look nice\n6. Free\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ncsu.edu/tourismextension/gallery/02/\"><img width=\"250\" style=\"float:right;\" src=\"http://content.screencast.com/users/charlie_morris/folders/Jing/media/83f84710-a252-4eee-95ec-2ceaf8ddae3d/2009-05-05_1054.png\"/></a>This is where SimpleViewer comes in. Essentially SimpleViewer is a free extensible Flash-based photo gallery template for which users can add and create as many albums as they desire. And when I say \u201cextensible,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.airtightinteractive.com/simpleviewer/instruct.html\">I mean it</a>. It has a number of options for how you want to set things up, both on the backend configuration side and on the gallery display side. For our purposes at CNR, we actually don\u2019t use any server backend for it. Instead we can rely on handy desktop software to organize the photo albums, specifically <a href=\"http://picasa.google.com/\">Picasa</a> (free, of course). As a user, you just have to download Picasa and then add a template file for SimpleViewer and then your off to the races (handy instructions <a href=\"http://www.airtightinteractive.com/simpleviewer/auto_desktop_instruct.html\">here</a>, as well as other desktop software). The rest of the workflow involves exporting from Picasa to an HTML templated version of your album (built-in process) and then sending that album to your local Webmaster (me) who in turn adds it to a Web directory and creates a link to it. Done. And in short time you could have something like <a href=\"http://cnr.ncsu.edu/ppf/gallery/\">this</a>. Or, to see an embedded gallery, something like <a href=\"http://www.ncsu.edu/tourismextension/gallery/02/\">this</a> (pictured above). There are actually many ways you can have a gallery display in your site including changing the background.\n\nThus I\u2019ve met all my requirements. I\u2019ve got a free and easy-to-use product that can create slick looking galleries without any intensive programming involved and Picasa does all the compression for a user too, so file sizes stay down. As advertised, it\u2019s a \u201cSimple\u201d viewer.\n\nLastly, SimpleViewer is not the only gallery template available. You can also choose from <a href=\"http://www.airtightinteractive.com/viewers/\">any of these</a> and work with them in the same fashion (Picasa template).\n\nOk, one more thing. I don't view this solution as the be-all-end-all. Ideally I'd love to have a kind of repository, almost like a locally hosted <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a> (or maybe just paying into a commercial Flickr account).

I could attempt to \"explain\" why RSS has been an issue, but I'll just say that, at least for the news site, it'll probably be fixed in the near future (think a couple weeks). Ah well, here's a brief explanation. The news site currently runs through a CMS that uses a static publishing model (and has some issues with automated workflows....long story), so the feeds that are generated have to be manually published whenever new content is created and added. To web people, it's a simple step, but one often overlooked by those only concerned with posting the story itself. While those web pros among us might gasp at the thought of this, it's just one of the things that happens. But it'll be fixed soon as the news site is moved away from the static publishing model and into a more dynamic environment. Again, soon.\n\nAs for the feature content on the homepage, different but related issue.

Light response rate, but helpful, enlightening comments.\n\nOne other thing that we've done with regards to Twitter is that I presented a Lunch &amp; Learn called, \"Twitter: Basic Use &amp; Professional Use,\" which filled up 25 seats in a matter of a couple of days. An interesting aside is that the first time I scheduled the class, I called it, \"The Glitter of Twitter,\" and we had to cancel the class because we had less than five people sign up for it.\n\nAmong the things I shared in terms of how we're using Twitter in business and how it can be used in business in general (in addition to the specific ways we're using to communicate with it) were:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Colleagues tweeting what we're doing during the day, using the hashtag #ncsu_oit. This gives us an awareness of what each other is working on, has spawned serendipitous helping/learning, \"Hey, I've done that before, if you get stuck or need some help on it, give me a yell,\" or \"Hey, I want to learn how to do that, can I come and observe you working?\" Also, just joining this organization in September, Twitter was invaluable in acculturating me to academia (I came from IBM), quickly made me feel like a valued member of the team, <i>and</i> I made some fast friends.</li>\n<li>To keep up with your industry\u2014who's doing what, where, why. Say you're interested in these areas of IT: Computer Operations, or Security and Compliance, or Enterprise Resource Planning, you can use something like \"TweetGrid\" (which searches the public timeline of tweets for tweets that match your search argument) to see what the global conversation is about them: <a href=\"http://tweetgrid.com/grid?l=2&amp;q1=computer+AND+operations&amp;q2=security+AND+compliance&amp;q3=ERP+OR+(enterprise+AND+resource+AND+planning)\">http://tweetgrid.com/grid?l=2&amp;q1=computer+AND+operations&amp;q2=security+AND+compliance&amp;q3=ERP+OR+(enterprise+AND+resource+AND+planning)</a></li>\n<li>To get customer feedback and \"the buzz\" about products you might support or sell. For instance, a Microsoft salesman who sells Office, might use this TweetGrid search argument to see what's being said: <a href=\"http://tweetgrid.com/grid?l=4&amp;q1=word+AND+microsoft&amp;q2=powerpoint+AND+microsoft&amp;q3=excel+AND+microsoft&amp;q4=outlook+AND+microsoft\">http://tweetgrid.com/grid?l=4&amp;q1=word+AND+microsoft&amp;q2=powerpoint+AND+microsoft&amp;q3=excel+AND+microsoft&amp;q4=outlook+AND+microsoft</a></li>\n</ol>\n\nSome of the challenges we've had and some things we still want to do include:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Determining whom to follow or follow back.<ul>\n<li>Some decisions are easy: students, faculty, staff from our own university are a no-brainer. What's hard about it is knowing that they are at times. Unless it's specifically stated in their profile, it's too time consuming to try and find out.</li>\n<li>Other Twitter accounts of organization at NCSU are usually good candidates; for example, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/NCStateNews\">@NCStateNews</a>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/NCStatePR\">@NCStatePR</a>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/NCSUEngLibrary\">@NCSUEngLibrary</a>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ncsuweb\">@ncsuweb</a>, and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ncsu_oit_ot\">@ncsu_oit_ot</a>.</li>\n<li>We try to follow accounts from which we might glean some content to retweet, so accounts such as <a href=\"http://twitter.com/higheredu\">@higheredu</a>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/techboard\">@techboard</a>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/nyt_tech\">@nyt_tech</a>, and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/chronicle\">@chronicle</a>.</li>\n<li>When someone follows @ncsu_oit, we usually take a gander at their profile, how often they generally tweet, and do a quick scan of the kind of content they tweet before following back. I know there is a philosophy out there that you should follow back every single person who follows you. As of now, I've not yet bought into that philosophy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We'd like to do analysis of who is following us to \"know our audience,\" as that's one of the three key elements of any type of communication (along with the purpose and context of the communication).</li>\n<li>We'd like to investigate the possibility of enhancing our class/workshop application to automatically tweet if there are still some open seats, say, two days before a class or workshop.</li>\n</ol>\n\nOkay, that's enough for now.

Not only are they the corporate force behind PHP, but they make an awesome Framework for PHP development, and a pretty decent IDE as well with Zend Studio. Those two products were typically where I stopped with Zend. I knew they had some other things out there for security purposes, as well as a Server product, but those really weren't important to me, and they cost like a hojillion dollars.\n\nBecause of my other involvement in Zend products, I am on their mailing list. A few months ago, they sent an announcement that they were releasing a free version of their Server product for personal and development use. I thought, \"cool, but I don't really need that right now\". At work, we develop directly in AFS, and use a central MySQL server, so there was no need to have a development environment on my local machine.\n\nWell, lately I have been having LOTS of issues with working with AFS from off campus, so I decided that I wanted to install something locally on my Mac to do development. OS X comes with Apache and PHP ready to go, but I wanted a seamless solution. One install to rule them all. I had installed MAMP a while back, so I decided to try that. Well, it was totally busted when I went back to try to use it, and I spent a few hours trying to figure out what was wrong with no luck. I decided I needed to try something new, so I decided to give <a href=\"http://www.zend.com/community/zend-server-ce\">Zend Server CE</a> a shot. I figured, what the heck, its free. And if it stinks, I could just delete it and give MAMP another shot.\n\nI downloaded the installer from Zend's website and had it installed in seconds. Complete with a management console, PHP 5.2.9, Zend Framework 1.7.8, phpMyAdmin and Apache 2, I was ready to go.\n\nTheir management console is really nice. It will let you search through the php.ini file and change any settings you need to (no more scouring the file system for php.ini, then changing it there).\n\n<p style=\"float: right;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/72-ZSCEmgmt.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/73-ZSCEmgmt.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"181\"/></a></p>\n\nIt also provides multiple technologies for improving your applications. Code acceleration, full page caching and data caching are included to improve response times and minimize resource utilization.\n\nThe only real downside I found was the lack of documentation. I guess because it is a very \"new\" product, that was grown from an existing product, so some of the documentation is incorrect. Like the docs said that my htdocs directory was in my Applications/ folder. It's not, it is in /usr/local/zend/apache2/htdocs. And it never told me what my initial password was for MySQL (btw, it is username: zend password: (blank)). Also, there was some quirks getting MySQL to run as localhost on the Mac. But a few quick searches on the internet led me to the answers.\n\nPerhaps one of the nicest things is that it bundled Zend Framework with the product, so it is one less thing I have to keep in my local directories. And since almost every single one of my projects is ZF powered, that was really nice.\n\nZend Server CE is available for Mac, Windows and Linux. Give it a shot. I know that lots of people use WAMP in the windows world, but this install seemed much better.","createdDate":"2009-04-28T13:54:08.000Z","updatedDate":"2011-01-26T17:39:33.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:6055","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","description":"I doubt we ever deploy Zend Server on our main web servers, but the CE version is HAWT for local development.

Also, to keep a consistent look and feel it is very important to have intuitive CSS set up and make sure that users understand which styles they should apply to headers, which to body content etc. -Dede","createdDate":"2009-04-28T16:17:57.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:6020","contributorName":"bethanyvsmith","description":"At the College of Ed we use Contribute so that all departments can update their own info.\n\nMy biggest issue with Contribute is that I have to give my users full access to the entire website, not just their section in order for it to work properly. Because we use CSS to drive our design all of that is at a higher level of access and without them having privileges to the whole site they see it as a stripped text only version.\n\nSo my choices are to give them access to just their area in afs and when they edit their webpages it doesn't make sense. Or give them full access in afs and control it via the Contribute Key and pray they don't know how to ftp outside of contribute &amp; blow up my website. Neither of these options I like.\n\nOtherwise, I really like Contribute of DW. My biggest issue with DW in the past was the whole local/remote concept. Contribute makes that easy. I will say that the thing I have had to keep on top of is the use of documents. For some reason everyone wants to put up a word document to be downloaded rather than having it in a web page. Then everytime they upload a new document it doesn't replace the one of the server, it just adds to it. Since they can't see the remote file structure I end up with a lot of unused documents on the server that eat up space.","createdDate":"2009-04-28T14:13:36.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:6001","contributorName":"35cq68t8q2xge","description":"I can't add too much to the discussion and the resources posted in the other messages.

Training = Don Schmidt = on campus resources has worked very well (Don continues to be my hero where training is concerned). Are there problems .. sure.. are there support needs..sure...

It's just so simple --open page, edit page, publish page-- and that is all our users (about 30) try to do with it. It has eliminated the bottleneck of getting sites updated. We do not have to write and enter content for people. The only alternative would be to put Dreamweaver around and that is overkill. There is no other browser-based editor that does what Contribute does. I was hoping there would be by now (we have been running Contribute for 5 years or so) but there isn't, AFAIK.

I am aware of the fact that ADA-standards exist and that and am not looking for a definition of the term WRT the web as a whole--but more am talking about what it is that Contribute does specifically that make its code non-ADA compliant. There are a couple scenarios I can think of, but depending on how much work they'd create for the \"web-type person\" to fix, those may or may not be dealbreakers for us.\n\nOn \"admins go for help\" I was more looking to get a sense of whether or not there is a Contribute support infrastructure on campus, or if there needed to be one. But it sounds more like individual departments purchase their own software and take care of their own support.\n\nThanks for your offer to be available as a training resource.

It's very user friendly in my opinion and the learning curve isn't bad at all. However, my understanding is that the code it puts out is not ADA compliant. We're actually looking at moving away from it for this reason. Aside from that, I'm not aware of any problems that are really worth mentioning.\n\nUsers typically like it and find it easy to use. People accustomed to being able to edit code, occasionally comment on not being able to do that with contribute. But, they don't typically have any real reason to touch the code anyhow.\n\nWe usually help them if they have problems or direct them to our tutorials. Supporting contribute usually consists of training up front or reminding a user of how to do something every now and then. Occasionally we have to deal with a lock file preventing a user from editing a page. There are times in which a user is having a problem or wants something done that's easier for us to just edit the code for them. If they're strictly updating content, i don't think that would come up much.\n\nTraining is not bad. We mostly do one-on-one training with folks when they first start using it, and that usually goes off without a hitch and people retain info. just fine. The time that takes typically depends on what the user wants to be able to do, and how computer savvy they are. I would say usually 30-60 minutes (less for some users). If you want more details about how I personally go about training users, feel free to shoot me an email or call.\n\nWe also do a class occasionally, but sometimes we get the same folks coming back for that or some of those people have trouble later. But that could be a problem with the current instructional model we're using, the specific people attending, and their motivation for taking the class. We also have tutorials available online for users - <a href=\"http://it.chass.ncsu.edu/training\">http://it.chass.ncsu.edu/training</a>.\n\nI'm not sure how to best answer your question regarding where admins go for help.

Well, you either discovered it yourself, or someone else showed it to you. Now...if you don't have colleagues showing you new things, and you're too busy to discover things for yourself, then you're going to have a hard time knowing about certain tools...certain tools with a few neat features even.\n\nIf only there was a tool that so clearly was linked to a profession...say.....Web Development. And just to make it easier for those people without helpful colleagues, the tool was named exactly the same as the profession. Enter, the \"Web Developer Toolbar (an extension for Firefox).\"\n\n<b><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60\">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60</a></b>\n\nI put the Web Developer Toolbar, into the category of \"if you know about it...you can't understand why anyone wouldn't know about it, and if you don't know about it, don't admit it, lest you be looked at like you have 3 heads.\" For many of you, you probably fall into the first group...the people who get to look incredulously at non-users who haven't heard of it yet. And so, this edition of Best Thing Ever is targeted at the second group...let's call them to \"Uninformed Unfortunates.\"\n\nThe Web Developer does many things, and there is too much to fit into one article, or at least too much for me to write about. So I'm going to focus on the few things that I use every day. Go ahead, install the extension, and you'll see where all this stuff is located... seriously ...I'll wait.\n\n<b>1. CSS -&gt;View Style Information (shortcut == Apple+SHIFT+Y)</b>\n\nThis allows you to hover your mouse over the pieces of the currently displayed website, and view the layout elements, as well as any style information. In the top of your window, you'll see the code that is applied to whichever element you are hovering over, and you'll get a red border around the element so you can be sure of what you're seeing.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/74-screenshot1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/75-screenshot1.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"38\"/></a></p>\n\nThis allows you see very easily what may be wrong with a page you're developing, or better yet, what may be right on someone else's site. You'll be able to see the beauty of css only layouts, and experience horrifying bewilderment as you move over nested tables.\n\n<b>2. CSS -&gt; Edit CSS (shortcut == Apple+SHIFT+E)</b>\n\nWhen you're wondering where you went wrong (I'm talking about an error with css, not where you went wrong in life), you would previously have to edit your css file, save, then return to the browser and refresh, repeating that loop until you've fixed the problem (or started thinking about where you went wrong in life).\n\nWith the web developer toolbar, you can edit the css of a page directly in the browser. This way, you can mess with it all you want during the troubleshooting phase, and then only commit the real solution to your css file. It will open up a tab (not a firefox tab) for every single css file that is referenced by the page, giving the option to augment any or all of the pages, making it easy to copy paste changes to your real css file. This is also interestingly useful when looking at other people's websites, because it gives you the ability to play a little \"what if\" game with their site. What if you turned off the menu....what if you changed the color of the links....what if you changed the banner graphic to something else, then took a screenshot of it, making it look like you developed a whole new site just like theirs....the possibilities are endless.\n\n<b>3. CSS -&gt; Disable Styles</b>\n\nSometimes you'll be working on a site with multiple stylesheets, and you won't know what's causing a problem. Maybe you have redundant styles that are preventing a new class from applying? With this option, you can turn off individual stylesheets, or all of them. This is most powerful when you have multiple stylesheets for separate purposes, like one for layout, one for text styles, one for table styles, one for form styles....I don't know why you'd do that, but its possible, and I've seen it done before.\n\n<b>Use what you use...forget the rest...</b>\n\nThere are many many many many other neat features to the toolbar...and I won't pretend to use all of them, or even know about half of them. The good thing is that you can use what you need, and forget the rest...until someone looks at you with those critical eyes, like their saying \"what?...you don't use the Display Stack Levels option....and you call yourself a Web Developer?\" I'm actually hoping that people will comment on this article and add their favorite toolbar hidden options.","createdDate":"2009-04-21T11:56:20.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-04-21T19:26:47.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:5837","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"Richard,\n\nFirebug will let you use hierarchical navigation and watch in real time as your JavaScript modifies the DOM.\n\nThe HTML Validator Addon will give display the Page Validation (without having to load it from a remote site) and clicking on its icon will show you the source with the full list of problems as well as highlighting where in the code each problem is occurring.","createdDate":"2009-04-21T19:26:47.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:5812","contributorName":"1eracb58xe19h","description":"One of my favorite features of the Web Developer Toolbar is the <b>Images-&gt;View Image Information</b> option, which will generate a listing of all images on a page, whether they're in image tags or there by CSS.

I find it very handy for when you have images layered over one another.\n\n<b>Miscellaneous-&gt;Display Line Guides</b> comes in very handy for quick measurement between items on a page when setting up a layout - my only complaint about this feature is the vertical line guide doesn't extend down past the screen height.\n\n<b>View Source-&gt;View Generated Source</b> is very helpful for viewing code when you're doing a lot of javascript DOM generation., since it will give you the source of the page at the instant you click the option instead of the standard View Source, which will only give you the source of the page on initial load.\n\n<b>Tools-&gt;Display Page Validation</b> gives you a handy toolbar telling you how many validation errors your page currently has - it updates on page refresh or tab change too.

The ubiquitous \"they\" has to manage and configure the web server process(es), manage the language environment(s) available (perl, python, ruby, php, etc.), and the connections between those language environments and the web server. Is it a site or an app? Both require an implementation and maintenance cost of varying levels - depending on experience with the environments/servers, vendor support, architecture, etc. While you might can draw a line between Apache opening an html file itself and sending it back out to browser and Apache handing off a file to the PHP module to interpret the PHP code in the file - it gets a bit harder to really draw solid lines between a simple php script that reads a text field out of mysql and prints it back out. or a guestbook form. Or mediawiki. Or drupal. All of the latter are a \"codebase\" - an app if you will - that has a lifetime, a maintenance need, an ongoing resource cost, etc. That simple PHP script is quite likely going to need a change when PHP 6, 7, 8 comes out. (We've had a lot of issues with this where folks are very willing to \"write an application\" or usually faculty very willing to volunteer us or request \"a web site\" or a \"web application\" - they almost always say 'site' - without considering the ongoing resource costs of implementation - and particularly maintenance).\n\nAt the design level, it seems impossible to draw a line, it's really a continuum. A single static page is different than a whole interconnected \"site\". A blog is different than a wiki, A wiki is different from Google Knol, Google Knol is different than twitter, twitter is different than gmail. Gmail is different than, well, everything else. All of which have different design considerations based on audience, content, the interactivity, and the technologies chosen to deliver it.\n\nSo I don't think you can draw a line here, either based on static vs. 'dynamic' or 'interactive' or not. Static html blogs are often WAY more 'dynamic' than most of our CMS-produced \"sites\" - but that CMS very, very has an ongoing management/maintenance costs. A very simple forum we spend two days on could generate WAY more interactivity than that conference application we spent hundreds of person-hours developing. And all of them could have vastly different design, traffic, maintenance, resource, technology, etc. needs and costs.\n\nI love my bukkits (the compartmentalization of these things) - but I don't think that site and application are the right bukkits here. It's very much a venn diagram of different characteristics and factors involved - or a gradient, or pick a favorite \"shades of grey\" metaphor.","createdDate":"2009-04-17T01:52:09.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:5735","contributorName":"2k7vvpf9lb3q6","description":"I think that we begin to cross the bridge from website to web application the minute the user has the ability to interact with the content.","createdDate":"2009-04-16T17:20:56.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:5732","contributorName":"1x58sgozterf4","description":"All good ways to look at the question. I think what's interesting is that there are, in fact, different ways to understand, interpret and explain the distinction between a web site and a web application.

Some of that stuff might be static, some of it might be fancy-pants web apps that do all kinds of neat tricks. The site itself is responsible for delivering that stuff, should it be the result of some complicated, intricate actions, a simple database fetch, or a some high quality copy/paste work.\n\nA few things I suspect most users won't ever think: If a web app isn't on the web, can it be a web app?

I have a Macbook, iPhone, iPod Nano, a Time Capsule, and some other miscellaneous accessories. I fell off the Windows bandwagon about 2.5 years ago, and have never looked back.\n\nWhile I have always loved Apple's hardware, the true beauty of Apple lies in their software. OSX is amazing, as is the iPhone platform. It was only recently that I was introduced to Apple's development tools: <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/technology/tools.html\">Xcode</a>, <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/technology/tools.html\">Interface Builder</a>, and <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/tools/dashcode/\">Dashcode</a>. (Note: These tools are only available on OSX...sorry Winders users)\n\nI have recently gotten into iPhone development (both native and web-based apps). The tools Apple provides for development make programming for iPhone super easy. Xcode and Interface Builder provide the foundation for building native applications, while Dashcode provides tools for creating web-based applications optimized for iPhone. My focus so far has been on web-based applications, so I can say with 1000% certainty that if you are going to develop an iPhone friendly web-based application, Dashcode is the best thing ever.\n\n<img src=\"discussions/76-Picture1.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"270\" style=\"float: right;\"/>Dashcode was originally introduced to give developers an easy way to create widgets for OS X's Dashboard. However, when the iPhone development kit was released, Dashcode got an upgrade to include iPhone web application support.\n\nDashcode gives you a nice interface to get you started. You can obviously start with a blank project, but Apple has helped you save some time by creating some commonly used templates like browsers, utilities, and an RSS reader.\n\nOnce you get your project started, you get a boatload of UI Parts you can drag and drop into your interface. Here is the real value in Dashcode. It has all the UI elements that you expect to see in an iPhone application, ready to drap and drop into your interface. This gives your web app a \"native\" look and feel, even though it is running through a browser.\n\nDashcode also provides alot of pre-written javascript code to help with things like processing AJAX requests and getting elements from your interface. You can also write your own javascript fragments and save those in the code library. So if you are constantly writing the same code over and over again, you can save yourself some time!\n\nWhen you are done with your project, Dashcode makes it easy to deploy the project to any WebDAV enabled account. You just setup your account, tell Dashcode where to put your application, and it handles uploading all the javascript, css, images, and HTML. Before you know it, you have a full-featured, iPhone optimized web applicaiton up and running!\n\nMy first little project in Dashcode was an app that did AJAX calls to a JSON script that pulled version information from some of our applications. It was a pretty simple project, and only took me an hour or so to put together. Without Dashcode, I would have had to spend lots of time worrying about formatting of the common iPhone interface elements like buttons, lists, and headers. Instead, I got to get straight to work on the point of the project, which saved a lot of time.\n\nSo if you are going to write some kind of web app for iPhone, and you want to save yourself a lot of time and energy, checkout Dashcode. You will quickly understand why it is the best thing ever.","createdDate":"2009-04-14T12:28:01.000Z","updatedDate":"2010-07-27T18:30:47.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:5659","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","description":"That sounds cool.

I thought i would check it out, thinking that there's no way a theme builder could actually work and be customizable enough for my needs. Well....it doesn't hit all the points i want, but what it does do, is save me a whole lot of time getting started with a custom theme.\n\nArtisteer is a theme builder, with predefined \"suggestions\" for anything from the whole site template, to the individual colors of links and text. The best part is that you can keep clicking any of the \"suggest\" buttons, and cycle through a bunch of different options...OR... you can just use the parts you want, then customize to heart's content. I usually start with a basic layout for the template (2 or 3 columns, menu location, width and background stuff)...then go in and tweak the styles of the blocks, block headings, articles and text/links too. After a while you'll get used to what it can and cannot do....and then you can figure out how much post-artisteer work you'll have to accomplish.\n\nThat's a quick look at the pros...now the cons....it doesnt have as many layout options as i would like. It is basically restricted to a 1, 2 or 3 column layout, with one main content area. The only thing i would add in there at the moment, is the ability to split the content area into two (or more) rows. That way it can be possible to put blocks in above your content once you create pages in drupal. Check it out though....the trial version will give you all the functionality you want....but you cant export Drupal templates. You'll have to shell out some $$$ for that. I think its just barely over $100. But i can say its already paid for itself by the amount of time it has saved me. Oh yeah...it also does Joomla, HTML, and Wordpress templates/themes too, and its all CSS.\n\n<b>Now, Drupal Theme Starter 1.0</b>\nIt is a video about Drupal Theme Starter 1.0, which is a GUI tool for developing your Drupal theme. It basically gets everything setup for you, including the *.info file. This won't get you a full colorized imagified spectacularized theme, but it will get you the framework to build upon.\n\nThe download for the tool is at the end of the video, but here's the direct link for those that want to skip ahead: <a href=\"http://xtnd.us\">http://xtnd.us</a>\n\nI havent used this one yet, but i think i will definitely be investigating it. It has the benefit of being free, and the flexibility of letting me layout the regions in any way i want. It doesnt go as far as Artisteer does, but it does not pretend to. This is going to very helpful to develop sites that have a more unique layout requirement.\n\nThat's all for now...check em out. I'll be interested to see people's opinions about the theme builder, as i havent used it much yet.","createdDate":"2009-04-10T12:31:10.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-04-10T12:31:10.000Z","approved":"Y","groupId":"2486881:Group:225"},{"id":"2486881:Topic:5563","contributorName":"38n6ifg2h285w","title":"Can't Understand Error","description":"Can anyone help me figure out what I'm doing wrong.

And each image is referred to by a simple css naming convention. Want a plus button? Just use the class ui-icon and ui-icon-plus. Done and done!\n\nYou can also have themed alert and warning boxes. This helps keep the messages in your app consistent and themeable.\n\nThis might not be the 100% most appropriate thing if you're not making web applications, but jQueryUI has saved us boat-loads of time. Making the decision to standardize all of our widgets and buttons has made our applications 93% more cohesive and structured. For us, it also helps make the line between our the underlying base application framework and the custom parts of the application nearly seamless.\n\nIf you write applications, already use jQuery, and want all kinds of neat features like themes, calendars, accordions, tabs, and dialog windows, then jQuery UI will change your life.\n\nGo here to get started with jQuery UI today! <a href=\"http://jqueryui.com/docs/Getting_Started\">http://jqueryui.com/docs/Getting_Started</a>","createdDate":"2009-04-07T12:42:49.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-04-09T12:27:08.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:5541","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"The wonderful part of using the Google loader thing is that if you always want to be using the latest and greatest (trusting Google not to host something broken - which they have been pretty good about) or want to allow minor updates to be included, you have a wide range of version specificity to choose from.

When we were researching versioning systems, I wrote a few pre-commit scripts for SVN that would compare submitted files with <a href=\"http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer\">PHP Codesniffer</a>, which worked OK but not great.

I am a BIG evangelist of coding standards (anyone who has taken any of the PHP classes Garrison and I have taught can tell you that I talk about them at length). I think it is one of the easiest, most beneficial things you can do for your project.\n\nAnd also, when I say coding standard, I'm not talking about the \"Jason-coding-standard\". There is absolutely no reason what-so-ever that one should create their own coding \"standard\". There are plenty to choose from. With PHP, abiding by either the Zend coding standard or the PEAR coding standard would be my recommendation, but it is up to your team. Just decide on one and stick with it.\n\nSome may argue that this is not needed if you are not doing team-based projects. It is my strong opinion that EVERY project should abide by a consistent coding standard from within your group, even if you are the only one who will be messing with the code. Odds are that one day, you won't be there anymore to fix a bug, add a feature, whatever...and someone else is going to have to do it.

I\u2019m sure there are a veritable plethora of these kinds of services out there, but for the sake of this piece I\u2019ll focus on <a href=\"http://www.last.fm\">last.fm</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pandora.com/\">Pandora</a>, <a href=\"http://pandorafm.real-ity.com\">PandoraFM</a> and <a href=\"http://somafm.com\">somafm</a>. All together these services have my iTunes app growing a very thick layer of dust. And my apologies for veering off of the web developers utilities topic, but hey, this stuff helps web developers stay sane and productive!\n\n<b>Pandora</b>\n\nSo the one name in there that I imagine everyone and their mothers have heard of is <a href=\"http://www.pandora.com/\">Pandora</a>, \u201cthe music genome project\u201d as it was called. Pandora was introduced to me back in 2005 or 2004, and I thought to myself: \u201chow can this be free?\u201d. A website that I can access anywhere, any time that plays a radio station centered on Del tha Funkee Homosapien? Keep in mind that at this period of time services like Napster, Kazaa and Limewire were dead or unreliable or of low quality and most importantly, illegal. Pandora filled the void of free music for the world. I won\u2019t go into the details of how Pandora works or where to find it, because that is how sure I am that everyone has used it. I will offer this tidbit though, for those of you who have smart phones, definitely get a Pandora app setup on your phone/iPod tocuh immediately.\n\n<b>last.fm\n</b> <img style=\"float:right;\" src=\"http://content.screencast.com/users/charlie_morris/folders/Jing/media/fec8b324-9090-4987-8e41-258e1e95b9cb/2009-03-31_1330.png\"/>\nSince being exposed to Pandora I have been introduced to <a href=\"http://www.last.fm\">last.fm</a>, which is a kind of blending of Pandora and Facebook \u2013 a social networking music service (not to be confused with MySpace). The basic way that it works is this: sign up for an account and then listen to music. Sounds familiar I know, but the magic happens when you actually listen to music, last.fm pays attention. Last.fm makes a record of every time you listen to a song; this is called \u201cscrobbling.\u201d You can scrobble from their website, from the last.fm player or your iPod. Over time as you listen to more and more music, last.fm will develop radio stations for you and give you recommendations. There\u2019s a bunch of other stuff that this site can do, such as\u2026\n\n\u2022 tell you how musically compatible you are with your friends.\n\u2022 let you tag your music\n\u2022 give you charts of what you\u2019ve listened to in x amount of time (see below for my overall top listened to artists)\n\u2022 create mix lists\n\n<table class=\"lfmWidgetchart_d81c23a03b0e1cf57d81a2c59401df2d\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"width:184px;\">\n<tr class=\"lfmHead\"><td><a title=\"cdmorris: Overall Top Artists\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/user/cdmorris/charts?charttype=overall&amp;subtype=artist\" target=\"_blank\"></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"lfmEmbed\"><td><object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" data=\"http://cdn.last.fm/widgets/chart/19.swf\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=7,0,0,0\" id=\"lfmEmbed_1779358061\" width=\"184\" height=\"140\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://cdn.last.fm/widgets/chart/19.swf\"></param><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"type=topartists&amp;user=cdmorris&amp;theme=red&amp;lang=en&amp;widget_id=chart_d81c23a03b0e1cf57d81a2c59401df2d\"></param><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"never\"></param><param name=\"allowNetworking\" value=\"all\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"quality\" value=\"high\"></param><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"d01f3c\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><param name=\"menu\" value=\"true\"></param></object>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"lfmFoot\"><td><table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"width:184px;\">\n<tr><td class=\"lfmConfig\"><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/widgets/?colour=red&amp;chartType=topartists&amp;user=cdmorris&amp;chartFriends=1&amp;from=code&amp;widget=chart\" title=\"Get your own widget\" target=\"_blank\"></a></td>\n<td class=\"lfmView\" style=\"width:74px;\"><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/user/cdmorris\" title=\"View cdmorris's profile\" target=\"_blank\"></a></td>\n<td class=\"lfmPopup\" style=\"width:25px;\"><a href=\"http://www.last.fm/widgets/popup/?colour=red&amp;chartType=topartists&amp;user=cdmorris&amp;chartFriends=1&amp;from=code&amp;widget=chart&amp;resize=1\" title=\"Load this chart in a pop up\" target=\"_blank\"></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<b>PandoraFM</b><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/78-20090331_1332.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/79-20090331_1332.png?width=250\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"247\" style=\"float: right;\"/></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://pandorafm.real-ity.com\">PandoraFM</a> is a creation by some group known as Real-ity that combines these two forces (Pandora and LastFM) into one website. You can login and easily switch between Pandora and last.fm, and what\u2019s really nice is that it can scrobble music you\u2019re listening to in Pandora. This is especially nice for me as I\u2019ve slowly become more and more obsessed with scrobbling. In the back of my mind when I\u2019m listening to music, I\u2019m always thinking \u2013 this should be scrobbled!

All in 140 characters or less.\n\n140 on the nose. Score.\n\nMore specifically, Twitter is a web service that facilitates \"microblogging,\" or communicating through 140-character posts or \"tweets.\" Users create short posts as frequently as they like, often embdding links, usually by taking advantage of any one of a dozen or so URL shortening tools (<a href=\"http://is.gd\">is.gd</a>, <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/\">tinyurl</a>, etc.) to keep the overall character count low. Posts then appear as a timeline, or list of updates, with the most recent first. Twitter users can choose to \"follow\" other tweeters and view the progressive collection of all their updates in a \"friends\" timeline. Tweets can be protected from view and only viewable to those to whom you grant permission, or wide open to the world allowing anyone to follow you or view your tweets. Users can essentially talk back and forth via twitter using the simple @username (the username is, well, the username of the individual to whom you wish to reply) to direct tweets at others. Twitter keeps track of all the tweets directed at you in the \"@replies\" timeline. Twitter also allows users to create channels or trends on the fly using the # character (#besthingever). The result is millions of short snippets of content in every conceivable direction and on every conceivable topic. Each user can aggregate a customized timeline of Twitter conent however he or she likes by choosing carefully (or indiscriminately) who to follow.\n\nMy friends timeline, which updates every three minutes in footer of my Firefox window courtesy of the <a href=\"http://twitterfox.net/\">TwitterFox plugin</a>, is currently full of tweets from co-workers at this and previous jobs, industry personalities and thought leaders, people I've met at conferences, news updates, Amazon Goldbox Deals, video game journalists and a handful of random people who often tweet about stuff I like. On any given day, the tweets from this collection of people will provide me breaking news in the industries of my choosing, new book recommendations, pithy music and movie reviews, web development tips and tricks, meeting, lecture and event summaries as they happen, great online bargains, links to new web development technologies and techniques, hilarious photos and YouTube videos, design or development advice, recommendations on just about anything, and, sadly, a daily account of what a few people I know eat for lunch and/or dinner and an account of the precise moment they arrive at and leave from work. You know who you are.\n\nLike most social networking and social media technologies, the value of Twitter is in the application of the application. At first I didn't get it. Twitter, at least for many, boils down to constant status updates. Really? Why would anyone assume I'm interested in their perpetual whereabouts, uninteresting cuisine choices and other inane commentary (LOLZ OMG 4REELZ @article). On the surface, there might not seem to be much more than the absurdly narcissistic Twitter employed by the overly-zealous, do-it-cause-everyone-else-is-doing-it, I-heart-everything-in-my-Web-2.0-tag-cloud-even-if-I-can't-figure-out-where-the-value-lies-but-who-cares-at-least-I-can-say-I-do-it Twitter.\n\nBut then I tried it and discovered that, in the right context and with the right application, Twitter might be the Best Thing Ever.\n\nConceptually, Twitter is much like an RSS feed, but Twitter feeds are personal, editorial, and often independent of any specific site or content source. More and more content-rich sites leverage Twitter to tease and link to their own content, providing yet another entry point for users. It works like word of mouth for the Internet.\n\nMuch like blogging, sifting through the mass of inane, uselss Twitter chatter is critical for the application to have any value. Fortunately, search.twitter.com makes this easier, as do any number of Twitter search tools and Twitter feed collection sites (like <a href=\"http://cursebird.com/\">cursebird</a>, a site that displays all the Tweets that contain curse words). Another invaluable way to build a robust list of Tweeters to follow is through the \"Following\" lists on each users page. Often you'll find users with similar interests worthy of adding to your twitter timeline. Much like the value of any particular blog, the value of a particular Twitter user's contributions stem from the content creators' authority, expertise and personality.\n\nThe web-based Twitter interface couldn't be much more simple. An empty text block in response to the perpetual question \"What are you doing right now\" paired with the remaining character counter sit atop the list of recent posts from everyone you choose to follow. Pages can be customized in look and feel to some extent, though utility reigns supreme on Twitter.com.\n\nTwitter offers a great way to keep your finger on the pulse of the Web, as parsed by your own, personally-assembled Internet editorial board. For all the meaningless proclamations of \"grilled chicken for dinner then bed,\" there are a handful of valuable, relevant, interesting and erudite tweets. And the resulting collection of content is profound.","createdDate":"2009-03-24T15:45:17.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-12-14T20:06:11.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:5681","contributorName":"1ou9m4evpyyeo","description":"Hmmmmm...

The final step is to determine the future best\nplatform for faculty and staff email including possible outsourcing.\n\n2) Require/expect students to have laptop computers and then\ndecommission at least 50% of the computer lab seats campus wide. This\nchange assumes that many of the required services can be provided\nthrough application delivery tools, license servers, student installed\nsoftware, open source and many other options. Specialized computer labs\nthat are still required for software or activities that cannot be\ndelivered through the above mechanisms would still remain.\n\n3) Unify web hosting and related services with a migration to\ncontent managed systems. This would move many/most of the websites to a\ncontent managed environment. Special websites that cannot be moved\ncould have an exemption. Web hosting for these environments at\ncompetitive pricing would be used. There is already a pilot going on to\nlook at environments that might allow this type of service.\n\n4) Move all staff and lab computer systems to a managed desktop\nenvironment \u2013 and move the appropriate staff systems to a virtual\ndesktop environment. Some of the colleges already use a managed desktop\nin which most of the functions are automated and it has reduced support\ncalls by 80%. This type of improvement needs to be shared throughout\nthe campus. In addition, many of the current desktops do not need the\ncomputational power of a standalone machine and desktop virtualization\ncan potentially save even more.","createdDate":"2009-03-24T15:42:10.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-04-10T15:42:59.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"Campus Policy/Procedures/Misc.","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:5597","contributorName":"halmeeks","description":"One last point about laptop initiatives.\n\nThe assumption is that students will carry their laptops with them all day, eliminating the need for labs.\n\nThis is an incorrect assumption.

If we do that, some faculty feel that a student laptop requirement is necessary because it would be the only way we could be assured of students actually having a laptop, which would be required as part of the instruction of the course. As an example, we had a couple of student-owned computing pilot sections of courses this semester that listed a laptop requirement as part of enrollment in the course. On the first day, we found over a dozen students who didn't own a laptop and so had to be relocated to other sections of the course.","createdDate":"2009-04-01T16:21:06.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:5344","contributorName":"halmeeks","description":"I have been told that we pay as much as $32.00 a month, but that number may be incorrect. It is certainly much more than $18.00 a month. I picked the number $25.00 out of thin air -- if we made it $20.00 a month, that is $12.00 less, and at $20.00, my voice plan gets bumped to a plan that I feel will easily cover the amount of phone traffic that I get. And on top of that, I get nation-wide calling -- no additional long-distance fees that OIT has to pay.\n\nBut it is not just the month-to-month costs. Not only do we pay for voice mail, there is a recurring cost that OIT pays for the voice mail system itself that everyone uses. There is the phone service itself -- part of the money goes to our operation of our campus phone system, part of it goes to the phone company, so there is savings there immediately.\n\nThere is equipment costs. The phone in your office. The infrastructure to run a phone system (equipment and people). The ongoing expense of maintaining and expanding this system to support more customers. Migration to VOIP. Do we want to spend money migrating to another wired phone service when the trend outside the university (unless you are in a dorm) is to \"cut the cord\" and do away with land lines? It is time for us to leapfrog.\n\nWe pay for people to have a Blackberry for messaging. Many of these people own another smart phone (iphone, PocketPC) that is capable of this. It is crazy for us to pay for a device that does the same thing that the user already has. Plus, it is just one more thing to carry.\n\nThe biggest issue with my scenario is segregation of phone numbers. We do not want clients calling on our \"real\" cell number. They should call our office number, which gets routed to our cell. This is to protect our privacy and downtime, but also to make sure that we are able to separate phone calls that are work related from those that are personal. One potential reason for this is that our work voice calls (and voice mail) may be considered public record.\n\nWe can re-route phone calls with our existing system, so it is not entirely necessary for us to migrate to Google Voice, but obviously it has features our existing voice mail system does not have -- but further than that -- it immediately saves us money, even for those that choose to keep their office phone.\n\nI don't think anyone has to lose their job. There are plenty of other opportunities for us to pursue. Off the top of my head, I would pick \"rich telephony\" -- video/web conferencing with phone/skype etc linkage as a cost-recovery service. Instead of leasing phones, we can lease things like Polycom units, multiple participant conferences (video and phone), etc. I expect demand for these services to increase as travel budgets evaporate. Many other campuses have offered these services for a while now. There is a working group on campus (which I am a member of) that is looking at these issues right now. We can route some of our cost savings into these new services, and recoup our costs. Instead of a department buying a Polycom that sits idle, they can can lease one for the time that they need it. It saves the university money, and provides a needed service.","createdDate":"2009-04-01T14:47:22.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:5326","contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","description":"I'm new around here, so maybe I'm not getting the cost savings of the cell phone idea.

Our own data shows that laptop ownership is on a sharp incline. We don't need to require students to do something that they are already doing. It is unlikely to save us much money, and may actually cost us money. UNC-Chapel Hill stopped their Carolina Computing Initiative for several reasons -- one key one is that cost of support went up. They are simply part of a trend; many schools that had laptop initiatives have abandoned them. If we make laptop ownership a requirement, it is assumed then that we are going to support those laptops. Maybe we can get the money from ETF, or perhaps we can just outsource support and make students pay for it. I can see the ed piece in the Technician now.\n\nClosing some Unity labs and substituting it with a laptop initiative has no dependency -- one does not imply the other. If we are going to close labs, the only savings will come from closing ALL Unity labs and relying on Colleges own computing facilities, and even then, the cost savings will take 2-3 years to filter through (replacement cycle for lab machines being the key).\n\nOne suggestion I have is allowing people to get rid of their office phone, give them a stipend for their cell phone ($25.00 a month, still cheaper than having a land line in their office). It saves equipment, resources, people and defers the need for expansion. We may not need to transition to VOIP at all. The other part of this proposal is to move to Google Voice, which allows us to replace our existing voice mail system, and to re-route calls to our cell phone without having to give clients our cell number.\n\n--hal","createdDate":"2009-03-31T17:15:34.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:5232","contributorName":"19wgwss45yepg","description":"The original #3, where we look into cpanel and outsourcing as ways to provide better web services, is not my idea. Credit where it is due, I first heard this idea from the Jason/Garrison/Everette group on campus, and we've all been working together to explore the options. In my humble opinion, it is NOT a cost saving option. The cheapest thing we could do is continue to offer a minimum of PHP service and let people explore the various add-on packages at their leisure. That is not good customer service on our part (as per the very vocal comments on TWW to that effect) and so we need to explore new options to get back into the program, far far more than we need to do this to save money.\n\nCost savings will come to play if/when campus adopts us as a hosting provider instead of making their own way. That will not happen is we cannot offer the specific packages that each and every department wants to use. Cpanel is a big step in that direction, in that is covers and simplifies most major PHP applications. It completely ignores the Cold Fusion users, and the ASP/IIS users. Much as I'd love to tell those folks they're doing it wrong (*grin*) that's not my call to make.\n\nWhat TWW fails to grasp is any sense of scale. It is no more efficient or cost-effective for us (OIT) to run 25 different one-off systems, than it is for 25 departments to run their own one-off systems. We can only develop an efficiency by getting people into the same system and figuring out how to support what they do within that system. Cpanel itself is easy. 25 different CMS-like packages within cpanel... is going to mean 25 different ways of running your websites. It is our hope that we can find a way to make this happen, but we know very well that support for the individual packages is going to be problematic. If you as departments still need to keep your FTE's worth of web support to maintain your packages with minimal help from us, then there's less cost savings there than the 50ft view seems to suggest. Sure, we can consolidate the hardware and keep it off your balance sheets, but you'll still be paying experts to maintain the sites on that hardware. Since I'm speaking mostly to those people employed in that capacity, I imagine this is good news. :-)\n\nAs for the ipsCA certificates... yes, lets move forward. It will take us the better part of a year to roll through all the certs as they expire. The bigger concern is to make sure the keepers of the Thawte contract are also planning for this move, so that it doesn't get purchased again when the contract renewal is due.\n\nEmail for faculty... this is my semi-informed opinion: Groupwise is going to fail. I cannot elaborate without mudslinging, so I'll just leave it at that. We need to stop NOW and go ahead and move all of campus, not just the students, to gmail. Cyrus mail can continue to support all of campus, as it has for many years. But in that regard, it's just like our web services... a minimum of service that no longer meets everyone's needs. I have 2 personal gmail accounts now and they work very well. I tried the student email pilot on gmail and msmail, and recommended to the committee that gmail was the clearly superior solution. As for cost savings... back at the time GW was the chosen solution, the proposal was expected to cost on the order of $1Mil plus maintenance. Envelope calculations in our suite put the gmail cost for faculty around $80,000, which is the amount needed to cover state-mandated backups. That's a 90% savings. There's still an overhead for campus-run relays that may or may not factor into both sides of the argument.\n\nOne last pot-shot... Boise State was one of the poster children for the Groupwise solution back when it was proposed. They have already seen the light and started their migration to gmail/Google Apps. <a href=\"http://helpdesk.boisestate.edu/email/groupwise/index.shtml\">http://helpdesk.boisestate.edu/email/groupwise/index.shtml</a>.

It is as necessary to the operations of this campus as electricity. In my mind, we should not be spending exorbitant amounts of money and time just to keep the email system running. It takes a lot of resources to just have it running effectively, including the life-cycling of equipment, the creation, maintenance and checking of day-to-day processes, support, and any other activities related to just keeping the email system switched on.\n\nWe are not in the business of creating our own electricity, because it is not cost-effective to do so. We take the electricity provided to us, and build efficient operations based on that platform. Email, to me, can now work on the same principle. We should leverage the ability of a provider (in this case, Google), to supply the base utility to us for a lower price than what we can provide in-house. What that allows us to do, is build upon that platform to better meet the needs of current and future projects.\n\nThe thing that disappoints me about the outsourcing of faculty and staff discussion, is that it is always framed in terms of money saved. The part that is lost or overlooked, and to me is the most important, is the improved set of tools Google can offer, over what we can provide in-house. Yes, money can be saved, and yes, that is very important in the current climate. But money is just one factor.\n\nEven if outsourcing only saved a relatively small amount of money going out the door per year (ie: licensing costs), it would save much more in intangible funds &amp; time, because we could have our best people working on adding services to what google offers, rather than just trying to keep the service switched on. If we want to become a leader and a demonstrator of innovation, then we need to allow our people the time to innovate. The great fact though, is that it does save a tremendous amount of money, as long as you consider ALL costs associated with it (licensing, hardware, software, backups, related-salaries, dedicated support personnel, related committee time, help desk support calls, customer satisfaction, , etc, etc, etc). If anyone can prove that keeping email in-house is as cost-effective as outsourcing to a competent provider and building on top their product, I'd love to see those numbers.\n\nHow about we trust somebody else keep the lights on for us? We can develop some pretty nice things when we're not running to the power meter and every light switch every waking moment, just to make sure it's still working.","createdDate":"2009-03-27T13:33:18.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:5224","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"\"People look at me like I'm stupid when I tell them I don't use MS Office products any more (at all).\"\n\nThat still scares me a little.

To me, the downfall of a large organization is that there are just a few more hoops to jump through, and bridges to build before you can implement new ideas.

I figured i would post them here to see what other people think. For some of them, we dont need to wait for a top-down directive...we can implement them ourselves while we wait to see what the overall vision will be. It's never too early to start saving money.\n\nHere is the bulk of the email sent to Dr Hoit\n\n<b>1. Convert all SSL certificates (where possible) to ipsCA free Educational SSL Certificates</b>\n<b>Suggested by:</b> Nick Young, nick_young@ncsu.edu\n<b>Potential Implementation Cost:</b> $0 (Time for systems administrators to install new certificates, but this is equal to the time they would be taking to renew existing paid certificates)\n<b>Potential Savings:</b> Estimated $10K-$20K per year\n<b>Implementation time-line:</b> Immediately, or as soon as existing certificates expire\n<b>Description:</b> ipsCA provides free SSL certificates for educational domains (*.edu) on a two year basis. At the end of each two year period, the certificates must be renewed. The renewal is free as well, providing a method of securing websites for free in perpetuity. There are currently around 100-200 certificates using Thawte certificates that cost approximately $100 per certificate year. Charles Brabec has tested the ipsCA certificates and posted his findings to the NCSU Web Developers Ning Website (<a href=\"http://ncsuwebdev.ning.com/profiles/blogs/free-ssl-certificates-for-edu\">http://ncsuwebdev.ning.com/profiles/blogs/free-ssl-certificates-for-edu</a>). His conclusion was that the ipsCA certificates are a viable alternative for securing websites, and can be implemented immediately. There are some policy issues that would need to be worked out, such as who the domain contacts would be for certificate approvals (the setup process requires a domain administrator to verify the request is valid), but other than that this could be implemented as each Thawte certificate comes up for renewal.\n\n<b>2. Power Saving Settings on Lab &amp; Office Machines</b>\n<b>Suggested by:</b> Nick Young, nick_young@ncsu.edu, Jen Riehle, jen_riehle@ncsu.edu\n<b>Potential Implementation Cost:</b> $0 (Time to decide upon a power saving utility, and implementation schedule)\n<b>Potential Savings:</b> 56% reduction of power use per computer, depending on a policy of configured power settings\n<b>Implementation time-line:</b> Immediately, or as soon as software can be approved and pushed out\n<b>Description:</b> For many employees there is no need to leave their computers on at the end of the day. The only reasons to leave machines on at night would be for scheduled processes to occur, or for telecommuting purposes.\n\nScheduled Processes: If scheduled processes (antivirus, spyware scans, backups) are the sole reason for leaving machines on, then there needs to be a standardization of when these processes will occur. This could be done on a campus-wide basis, or an individual building solution. For example, all full antivirus scans could be scheduled to run on Mondays and Thursdays. Every other night, the machine could be switched off. This should not affect the real-time scanning of the computers, and so should not increase risk of infection. In a typical work week (8-5) an employee may leave their machine on every day, every night, and on the weekends. This means their machine would run for 168 hours. By having them turn their machines off on tuesday, wednesday, and friday afternoons, they would only have their machines on for 75 hours per week. This means that 93 hours of savings would be realized or a 56% reduction.\n\nTelecommuting Employees: Where possible, wake-on-lan network cards should be installed, so that telecommuting employees can still remote desktop to the office computer. This would mean that they could also participate in the schedule mentioned above, where they could turn their machines off on several days per week, and not affect their ability to work from off-site locations.\n\nPower Saving Utilities: Although all computers come standard with power saving settings, many people either don't use them, or don't use them effectively. In concert with the scheduled process changes above, if there was a centrally approved/recommended power saving utility, more people may configure their settings properly. Verdiem (<a href=\"http://www.verdiem.com/edison.aspx\">http://www.verdiem.com/edison.aspx</a>) has a utility which will tell the user exactly how much power has been saved, and when the computer is most used. These details can empower employees to make better choices about when they leave their computer on and when they shut it down completely. There are many utilities available, and maybe it can be a decision made by individual departments/offices, but in any case, there is potential to combine the efforts of many people to achieve better power savings through a simple software install.\n\nPublic Relations: If we consider a utility that can record power usage per computer, per building, then it will be possible to communicate the efforts to the rest of campus as well as external constituencies. This is beneficial from a public relations standpoint, and showing that we are not only interested in saving money, but doing our part for the planet as well. This is a particularly timely article that i found after the email was sent to Dr Hoit: <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/environment/2009-03-25-pc-power-company-costs_N.htm\">http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/environment/2009-03-25-pc-power-company-costs_N.htm</a>\n\n<b>3. Move all faculty &amp; staff to Google Apps for Education immediately.</b>\n<b>Suggested by:</b> Nick Young, nick_young@ncsu.edu, Garrison Locke, gplocke@ncsu.edu, Jason Austin, jfaustin@ncsu.edu, Jen Riehle, jen_riehle@ncsu.edu\n<b>Potential Implementation Cost:</b> Faculty &amp; Staff will require archiving / document retention services as per state guidelines. $8.50 per user for Postini services, but it may be possible to repurpose existing servers to provide archiving tools. Time to develop policies and procedures for implementation\n<b>Potential Savings:</b> Eventual 100% elimination of licensing costs for GroupWise &amp; other on campus email services\nElimination of all college/departmental email servers. Elimination or re-purposing of central servers that provide Groupwise and/or Cyrus\n<b>Implementation Timeline:</b> Immediately, or as soon as policies can be created and approved to deal with an outsourced model.\n<b>Description:</b> If a \"move everyone at once\" policy is not possible, rather than spend the next 2 years moving everyone on campus to a centralized GroupWise system, we could move each pocket of campus gradually to Google (starting with OIT). The benefit of this would be reduction in licensing costs over the next 2 years for those users who would have been moved to GroupWise, as well as being able to decommission hardware in colleges that provide their own email services. Archiving for faculty and staff would need to be addressed, but this could be outsourced through Google's partnership with Postini, or provided in house by continuing to use OIT's central email servers as mail relays, essentially capturing everything that passes through before relaying onto Google.\n\nOne of the main reasons why the student email task force eliminated Microsoft's offering, was due to cross-platform, cross-browser issues. GroupWise, even in the latest release, has the same issue of providing a different user experience to different platforms. It does not support open calendar protocols (ie: CalDAV), therefore forcing every user to use either the GroupWise fat client, or the GroupWise web client.\n\nIt is difficult to find anyone who believes that GroupWise is the final solution for email and calendar services on campus. Supporters of GroupWise give it a lifespan of a few years at best, before we move to an outsourced solution. Why not save money right now, and rather than move people to a temporary solution, move them to something that at least has the chance of being a permanent solution.\n\n\n----- That's all....good ideas? bad ideas? any other ideas that people are implementing in small ways that maybe the rest of us can benefit from?","createdDate":"2009-03-25T16:49:38.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:5081","contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","description":"Agreed. In my former life i was a Director of IT at a smaller private institution, and these kinds of discussions were a regular occurrence. In fact, i was able to pull my own budget efficiency strategies that i submitted at that college, and suggest some of them to Dr Hoit.\n\nIt seems that larger institutions are a little more insulated to these kinds of 'efficiency' discussions, simply because the funding spigot is always on, even if its a low-flow model. At the smaller private institutions, you're worry is not about some people losing their jobs...its whether the whole institution will go under.\n\nI hope this crisis is a seed for making people realize how interconnected we are. We should not regress to grudges of the past (easy for me to say..I'm new here), but rather take this as an opportunity to collaborate to make things operate more efficiently AND effectively. Clinging to things because 'that's the way we've always done it' is not an effective way to operate. Efficiency and effectiveness strategies are not a one-time deal that you address when the CIO sends an email. It should be something we attempt to address in an intentional manner, and on a regular basis (if not daily).","createdDate":"2009-03-25T11:27:50.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:5060","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","description":"DISCLAIMER: I have no inside info on any of this stuff.

With custom attributes, you have to decide if caching makes sense or if it's going to work with the refresh implementation.\n\nIt would have been nice to find out what the accessibility recommendations are for Breadcrumbs, such as which tags to use to denote the hierarchical nature of the information.

If you don't see your favorites here stay tuned for more next week. And the personal suggestions and favorites you guys have contributed have been fantastic so keep it up!\n\nI'm not as nice as Nick so there are no screen shots but let me know if you have any questions about any of these tools.\n\n<b>Firefox Accessibility Extension</b> - <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5809\">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5809</a>\nThis is just a good idea. Built by the folks at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, this tool works for users with disabilities and for web developers testing pages. This Add-on is unique in that it adds a menu button (which I prefer to the also-available toolbar). From there you can run reports, preview navigation and scripts from an accessibility POV and use any number of available tools and validators. And before you say \"Hey, the Web Developers toolbar does that too!\" let me say that this Add-On has much better (and more strict) testing standards for its pages. I honestly think that the UI site's Functional Accessibility Evaluator (<a href=\"http://fae.cita.uiuc.edu/\">http://fae.cita.uiuc.edu/</a> ) is the standard we should all be aiming for.\n\n\n<b>FlashBlock</b> - <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/433\">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/433</a>\nI don't know about you guys but it seems to me that Firefox sometimes runs REALLY slow. It could be that I always have at least two Firefox windows open with ten to twelve tabs or it could be my snoozy Intel Pentium processor but regardless, it's a pain. I did a fair bit of research on how to speed things up (or more accurately, make Firefox use less of my processing power) and this was one of the suggestions. Just start her up and all the Flash on your page will be replaced with a little Flash icon that you can choose to click on if the Flash is Flash you want. And you'll be surprised at just how much Flash is out there slowing you down. Think about some of those obnoxious, flashy, bouncy ads out there... you won't miss 'em.\n\n\n<b>Fast Dial</b> - <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5721\">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5721</a>\nThis is one I use every day. I don't know how I found it but it's definitely a favorite. This will give you a new home screen when you open a tab. The screen will give you 4, 6, 9... however many windows you choose and fill them with the screenshots, links to pages you choose, typically your most-visited pages. Simple, but infinitely useful.\nI will mention that some reviewers have given Fast Dial some negative reviews. For some reason the developers seem to have removed some functionality in their latest version; I'm hoping they see the error of their ways. I've also been frustrated with the tools for setting up my Fast Dial links. Look for those tools in the Add-Ons menu &gt; Fast Dial &gt; Preferences. Or try hovering your mouse on the top right-hand corner of the screenshot windows to make changes.\nIt's still awesome, though.\n\n\n<b>Foxmarks</b> - <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2410\">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2410</a>\nI think this is one of the staples for anyone who uses Firefox: automatic syncing of your bookmarks on all your machines. Set up an account with Foxmarks at <a href=\"http://www.foxmarks.com/\">http://www.foxmarks.com/</a> . Then follow the very simple instructions to have Foxmarks back-up your bookmarks. Install Foxmarks on all your other machines and login with your account ID and password to sync the bookmarks on a new machine. Update your bookmarks by clicking on the little icon in the lower right-hand corner of your Firefox browser. Very easy.\nFoxmarks will do some other stuff as well, such as storing your passwords and securing them with a PIN. I haven't tried this (paranoid and not yet brain-dead) but it will also let you do all your syncing and password-saving to your own server if you want to provide one.\n\n\n<b>FireFTP</b> - <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/684\">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/684</a>\nOh, look! Another extension that starts with \"F\"! How original! This is one I don't use that often but when I remember it I'm very happy. FireFTP will open an FTP client in a Firefox tab. It's pretty fully-featured and very intuitive (you've seen one FTP client you've seen 'em all) and although it does work on Windows, Mac and Linux some additional downloads may be required. The FireFTP launcher is in the \"Tools\" menu so don't forget about it; there's actually another Add-On to put a FireFTP button on your toolbar.\n\n\n<b>Twitterfox</b> - <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5081\">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5081</a>\nTwitterfox is an Add-On that will let you connect to your Twitter account(s) and view/update your Twitter feed from within Firefox.\nOh, wait, I forgot... we haven't really talked about Twitter on here. If you're a person who doesn't use Twitter, doesn't \"get\" Twitter or doesn't know what Twitter is, stay tuned. We'll have a Twitter \"Best Thing Ever\" in the coming weeks.\nIn the mean time, those of you already on Twitter might want to consider consolidating your open applications by managing your tweets in Firefox. A little icon in the lower right-hand corner let's you know when new posts arrive and you can expand the view to see all recent tweets and add your own.\nI feel the need to qualify this recommendation by saying I don't actually use this Add-On. I don't really like the Twitterfox interface, so although I think it's a cool Add-On, I still use Twhirl. I am optimistic that they'll improve the interface, however, and the developers have been doing regular updates every 2-3 weeks or more so it's definetely kept-up.","createdDate":"2009-03-17T12:16:38.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-12-04T19:34:21.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:5142","contributorName":"0sar17vraypai","description":"There is a page I ran across on Digg today.

Generally, the remedy ticket comes in, we check it out, and try to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. Sometimes it is very quick, but sometimes it takes a little longer because we were not the people who originally developed the website. It would be helpful if we could easily find the original developers, so either they could resolve the issue, or at least help point us in the right direction. This becomes quite necessary when dealing with graphics that need to be altered, or navigation that doesn't immediately make sense.\n\nSo, what I'm asking is for ideas on the best way to store this information. I'll pose this as the starter idea:\n\nIn the .htaccess file at the root of any ncsu website, add the following information as a commented section:\n\n# Begin Author Information\n# Date: (site launch date)\n# Lead Author's Name (or multiple author names)\n# Department:\n# Email Address:\n# End Author Information\n\nThis way, it can be replicated on any website developed on campus, and can be found in the same place for any website at all.

We will obviously have more discussion when the small group of us meet about this topic, but here's a few of my thoughts.\n\nIf you centralize the information into a .htaccess file, then it is more easily kept up to date, rather than having to manage meta data on every single page on the website. Not all developers use templates, and those using a CMS may not be able to implement (easily) a solution that requires meta data to be posted to multiple pages.\n\nThe information i originally intended to store, was centered around developers. What kind of information does a developer need when inheriting or maintaining a website. This was the original problem that we tried to solve. With that in mind, the htaccess solution may meet those needs, as the developers will have access to that file.\n\nI cannot really think of a reason why regular visitors to the website need to be given information about the inner organization of the staff of created the site, or where it lives in AFS, or what symlinks are working for that particular site. If a regular visitor to the site needs to know who authored the site, they can look at the actual content of the site, the contact us page, or do a AFS locker lookup in sysnews to figure out where it lives in the server structure.\n\nHaving said all that, it is quite possible that a hybrid solution may be the way to go. Maybe a simple set of metadata, but then a more complete set of information stored in .htaccess (or some other hidden file?).\n\nI'm waiting to get some more input or interest from the community before trying to organize a meeting, so whoever is interested, please let us know.","createdDate":"2009-10-14T13:35:59.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:9544","contributorName":"0qsx0ul0q1hyu","description":"Nick,\n\nWe've been waiting for a resolution to this issue ever since I've been here (9+ years).\nThis idea is an option - However, the Owner/Author information needs to be easily found and accessed by anyone - including the Web page visitor.

Centralized database of website information (a full compliment of info about the site), which is updated by the developer upon launch, and then by the party who is maintaining the site as time moves on.\n\n2. Decentralized method of storing simple details about the website. Probably not in an .htaccess file, but something that can be placed in any NCSU directory. An equivalent of robots.txt was mentioned.\n\n\nAs mentioned before, it might be helpful to start with a narrow scope (ie: #2 above), and then branch out from there. How about a file called something like \"siteinfo.txt\" and it contains the following:\n\n-- Developed/Designer Information (Name, Dept, Unity ID's, Email)\n-- Last major version/launch date\n-- \"Supported by\" information, if different than the developer information. (Name, Dept, Unity IDs, Email)\n\nIn order to help people learn or remember that the siteinfo.txt is there, would it be helpful to put a comment line into the htaccess file that refers to it?

I dont think we need to reinvent the wheel if someone has already built it for us.\n\nI guess the htaccess file may not be the best idea, for the permissions reason you mention. The reason i thought this may be the easiest solution, is because i was only considering it for use when developers are needing to update the site. If they are updating the site, then they'll have permissions to the htaccess file, and if they arent supposed to update the site, then there'll be no need for them to see the metadata we are talking about. I guess there will be times when you may need to see the metadata, in order to direct a troubleshooting request to the proper person, so that puts a vote in the column for a non-htaccess solution.\n\nJohn -- could you explain a little how you are using the dublin core standard for the library? you mentioned the level of maintenance varies....how so?\n\nI wonder if we can keep our scope fairly narrow to begin with, or maybe specify a smaller set of 'mandatory' information, and then if people want to include extra, they can choose that on a site by site basis.

Or should we decide on a method of storage first, and then figure out the data later? I guess we could tackle them at the same time too.

They may not warrant an entire article about each individual extension (we'd have enough articles for the rest of the year if we did that), but collectively they form a nice collection of development tools.\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list. Look for Part II next week by Jen Riehle as she profiles her favorite extensions.\n\n<b>ieTab</b>\n<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1419\">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1419</a>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/83-ieTab1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/84-ieTab1.png?width=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"86\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/85-ieTab2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/86-ieTab2.png?width=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"94\"/></a></p>\nSo...you know you have to test your websites in all browsers, but you really don't want to open Internet Explorer even for a second. You're heart is telling you never to double-click on that little blue 'e' but your head is saying you have to. Wait...you could send the link to a friend with Internet Explorer and let them tell you if \"it looks right.\" But then you're risking infecting your friend with continued exposure to a sub-standard browser. Enter \"ieTab\" to save your day (and your friend's day too). ieTab allows you to view web pages within Firefox as if you are running Internet Explorer. It's so simple. Add the extension, then just click on the icon in the bottom right corner to switch the rendered view. Click it again to switch back to render in firefox.\n\n<b>ColorZilla</b>\n<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/271\">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/271</a>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/87-colorzilla1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/88-colorzilla1.png?width=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"144\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/89-colorzilla2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/90-colorzilla2.png?width=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"144\"/></a></p>\nIf it's got zilla in the name, it must be a monster of an extension. Not really. This is just about the smallest addon you'll find, but can save you a bunch of time. If you want to know exactly what color a website is using, don't take a screenshot, open in photoshop, use the color picker, then look at the hex values. Install 'ColorZilla' and use your new built-in color picker within Firefox. It appears as a eye dropper in the bottom left corner. Simply click on it, and then click on the website somewhere to get the exact color being used. There's even a preview as you scroll across the page so you know exactly which one you'll be choosing (very helpful when it comes to striped background tiles). This is a good companion to the Web Developer Toolbar's \"View Color Information\" option, which will give you a list of all the colors being used on a site. That is particularly useful for viewing a site's entire palette.\n\n<b>MeasureIt</b>\n<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/539\">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/539</a>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/91-measureit1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/92-measureit1.png?width=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"155\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/93-measureit2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/94-measureit2.png?width=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"155\"/></a></p>\nHate guessing the size of an image, or the distance between div elements? Need to bump an image a little closer to something else? You could make a change to your css, return to the browser, refresh, make another change to the css, return to the browser, refresh...rinse and repeat-style...OR...you could use 'MeasureIt' to get a pixel-perfect measurement of anything on the page you're viewing. It appears as a small ruler in the bottom left corner of your window. Click once on it to get a draggable marquee, which tells you the height and width as you drag across the screen.\n\n<b>Lorem Ipsum Generator</b>\n<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/198\">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/198</a>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/95-loremipsum1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/96-loremipsum1.png?width=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"136\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/97-loremipsum2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/98-loremipsum2.png?width=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"136\"/></a></p>\nDeveloping a template for a website and need to fill in some dummy text? Need to see how the site stretches and conforms to small and large amount of text? Old method: go to lipsum.com, click some options, select the generated text, copy, return to your template, paste. There is a quicker way. The LoremIpsum generator sits in Firefox and will let you generate as much dummy text as you would ever want or need. It will generate any number of characters, words or paragraphs in Lorem Ipsum, Epsum Factorial, Li Europan, or Ma Quande (whatever those last 3 are). Dummy text is dummy text, but i guess if Latin is not your thing, you could use one of the others provided. A \"copy to clipboard\" button in the extension is a neat feature whcih saves at least a couple of clicks.\n\n<b>FEBE (Firefox Environment Backup Extension)</b>\n<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2109\">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2109</a>\nWorried about the safety of those around you if Firefox ever lost all your extensions that you've spent an epic amount of time configuring? FEBE allows you to backup and restore all of your installed Firefox extensions and themes. It actually creates individual installable .xpi (or .jar for themes) files that you can put on CD, Flash Drive or floppy (do they still make those?) and install on another computer. You could also backup your extensions before installing an extension upgrade. This way you could always go back if the upgrade doesn't work for you. The best part is you can schedule it to run automatically, so you never have to worry about forgetting to look after your prized configuration in the event of an unexpected crash. After all, aren't they all unexpected crashes? It's not like you get up in the morning and say \"yep...today is the day i'm going to crash Firefox and lose all my stuff.\"\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/99-FEBE1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/100-FEBE1.png?width=274\" alt=\"\" width=\"274\" height=\"300\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/101-FEBE2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/102-FEBE2.png?width=274\" alt=\"\" width=\"274\" height=\"300\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/103-FEBE3.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/104-FEBE3.png?width=274\" alt=\"\" width=\"274\" height=\"300\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/105-FEBE4.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/106-FEBE4.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"182\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/107-FEBE5.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/108-FEBE5.png?width=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"79\"/></a></p>","createdDate":"2009-03-10T12:54:57.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-03-16T12:28:01.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:4683","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"The best theme I've seen is the Linux default theme which I'm guessing (based on the logo) is called \"Tango!\".","createdDate":"2009-03-16T12:28:01.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:4644","contributorName":"3p7bzgj31hmap","description":"VERY happy to learn about measureit, useful it will be (channeling yoda).\n\nMy FF add-ons:\n-Firebug\n-Webdeveloper (a must)\n-GSpace (for my personal computer, this takes advantage of all that free space google gives out)\n-delicious (also a must)\n-colorzilla\n-download status bar\n\nAnd also, I use the theme called \"Whitehart.\"\n\nGreat post!","createdDate":"2009-03-14T14:45:31.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:4616","contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","description":"I love tabs.

In that meeting, Dr. Hoit laid out his plans for OIT, as well as touching on some projects and budget issues, but one thing from the SOP stood out to me: he wants collaboration and transparency...and he wants it everywhere.\n\nAssuming you have read just about anything that I have posted on this site, you know that I am a big fan of both collaboration and transparency. While both are the ultimate of buzzwords, they can have real meaning and value behind them, but you have to work at it.\n\nMake no mistake. I appreciate so very much a directive to be transparent and to collaborate. But one glaring omission in Dr. Hoit's presentation was the \"how\". We've gone years and years without any directive <i>to</i> collaborate and be transparent. Well, now we have a directive, but I'm not sure OIT is really ready for it. Are we willing? Sure. But I don't know if we are trained in the ancient ninja art of collaboration and transparency. SOOOOO I bring this to you guys....a few simple questions so I can help myself and my colleagues:\n\nHow do you do business transparently, and do it effectively?\n\nHave you determined your costs regarding time, resources, etc. to being \"transparent\"? If so, what are those costs? Did you have a tipping point that said \"it's worth it here, but not here because it would take too much (whatever resource we currently don't have)\".\n\nAre there certain tools you use to aid in your transparency and collaborative efforts? What did you try that worked and that didn't?\n\nWhat direct benefits have you gained from being \"pervasively transparent\"? How did you measure your success?\n\nHow can good cooperation across division, college, department, etc. be facilitated? Is it going to have to be a grassroots effort or should it come from the top?\n\n\nI'm hoping someone will come back with a \"magic pill\" which will instantly make us good stewards of collaboration and transparency, but somehow I doubt that is the case. And yes, before anyone points out the obvious, I know the tool/technique depends on the situation, but I want to know what has worked for you.

Transparency, for me is no different. Transparency, at its root just means that information is being exposed for people to discover. The key here, is that the information needs to be usable once it is discovered. Transparency for transparency's sake is a waste of time.\n\nSo here's my ideas for simple things we can do immediately to achieve more effective transparency:\n\n1 - mandatory (and enforced) posting of meeting agendas and minutes to a central location, that has RSS feeds available for each committee. Even the most interested and motivated people won't go out of their way to find all the different committee minutes that reside all over the web.\n\n2 - website that aggregates all the committee feeds into one location, so that when a new committee is formed, you can get a notification about it. Then you can subscribe if you wish, or ignore and move on with your life.\n\n3 - common template for meeting minutes that promotes interest and discussion <u>outside</u> of the committee itself. This <u>MUST</u> include an overview of the minutes...a table of contents if you will. IE: at the top of each set of minutes, just a quick bullet list of the items that will are included below. If the meeting minutes are brief, there may be no need for this. This becomes important when feeds are available, so that people can very quickly see what the topics of discussion were, and not have to drill down into layers of text to find what was actually talked about.\n\n4 - transparency cannot be the sole target. <u>Effective</u> transparency must be the goal. At each small step of the process, the people communicating must take a few seconds to ensure that what they are divulging is both understandable and a benefit to their audience. Eventually this becomes second nature. It does not benefit anyone to have boat-loads of information thrown at them in the name of transparency, if you get buried under the weight of the content. This does not mean that information is removed from the record for being too wordy or full of jargon. It simply means that there may need to be that list that simplifies the document down to its key topics.\n\n5 - Grassroots movements are generally, in my experience more effective than individually led top-down directives. For me, its a numbers game. If you have 50 people on lower levels all working for the same thing, its better than having 1 upper level administrator pushing an agenda that has no grounding with the peons below. The best process IMO, is to find your supporters first. Find out who supports your idea or your project. If you don't find anyone that agrees with you, maybe you need to focus elsewhere. If you find people have a stake in what you are doing, then you can grow from there. The people that have a stake might often be the lower level people (there's your grassroots peeps), but ideally you'll want to identify an upper level person who shares your vision. While you're working on getting the idea off the ground, you can have that upper level person making sure the ceiling isn't so low you're going to bump your head as soon as you all stand up.\n\nMaybe I'm naive (but in my experience i dont think so) :-) .... but i think that the most simple solutions are often the best. Once you solve the small issues, you can take on the larger ones. If we make it easy for people to post information AND we make it easy for people for find and digest that same information, we've taken a big step towards effective transparency.","createdDate":"2009-03-10T11:55:46.000Z"}]},{"id":"2486881:Topic:4287","contributorName":"1m89sv3p0ar0c","title":"SIS Feeds","description":"Mike Vysocka and I were talking today about the new SIS feeds coming out of People Soft.

To quote another famous comedian, \"I find your lack of faith disturbing.\" ;-) But that's not really the point, is it? Your comments juxtaposed against Hal's clearly show that CMS value is derived from from end user--you on the \"programmer\" end of Hal's scale with your preference for Drupal and he on the \"content creator\" end where usability is at least as important as good code.\n\nBut we do aim to satisfy around here so if you want Drupal in the mix, check out:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.goodwebpractices.com/other/wordpress-vs-joomla-vs-drupal.html\">Wordpress vs Joomla vs Drupal</a>","createdDate":"2009-03-11T19:45:16.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:4241","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"I saw this article and was disappointed that they didn't choose to evaluate Drupal.

Fixing core functionality in lesser products such as Joomla is like starting the website over from scratch.\n\nUltimately, comparing a simple tool like WordPress to a multi-featured Joomla installation is like comparing a bicycle (which is quite effective and has a simple design) to a Walmart vacuum cleaner (it might do what you want with its plurality of connectors... in a wasteful though diverse sort of way). Of course, when you want to do much other than \"riding a bike\", you'll need a Wordpress technician to modify your bike into some mangled human-powered vacuum.

An RSS feed aggregator\n\nI love me some news. I scour the internet looking for new things to read, new blogs to follow. It is an obsession really. So much so, that I was using a complicated system of bookmarks and good ole fashioned memory to remember all the sites I wanted to go to. That's all well and good when you have 3 or 4 sites you go to, but when you try to check 40 - 50 sites a day, it gets VERY time consuming.\n\nHere is where an RSS feed aggregator comes in to play. For a while, I tried to use Thunderbird's built-in RSS reader. It did most of what I needed it to do, but it relied on Thunderbird, which is not a web-based application. That means that when I read a feed from home, it wouldn't mark it as read on my work computer. This is a pain because I am a multi-machine type of dude. It's just how I roll :) Also, the main reason I switched away from Thunderbird is that I couldn't read the alt tag on XKCD, which meant I missed half the joke. That just made me angry.\n\nHere is where Google sweeps in and saves the day. Most people, it seems, have at least heard of Google Reader, but a lot of people haven't ever given it a go. Since it is Google, it is online, which means that no matter where I read my feeds, they are consistently marked as read...even if I read them on my iPhone.\n\nGoogle reader also has some nice features that you don't get in other feed aggregators. One of my favorites is that it marks items as read as you scroll through them. This is a feature you can disable, but it prevents me from having to \"mark as read\" everything I read.\n\nIt also has the ability to star certain posts, so that you can refer back to them easily. This is helpful if I am reading something at home, but I want to make note of it so I can do something with it at work.\n\nGoogle Reader also allows you to share stories. It's sorta like syndicating your own aggregations. You can mark any story as \"shared\" and instantly, it will be added to a custom Google Reader page for your account. It is a cool way to share interesting stories through RSS.\n\nA few other features that are important to highlight that might convince you of Google Reader's superiority:\n\n* It's simple to import your feeds from the feed reader you may already use\n* Easily export your subscriptions as an OPML file\n* Easily add a subscription to Google Reader from any webpage via a convenient bookmark\n* Available in over 20 languages (even Australian English!)\n* Keep your subscriptions organized in folders\n\nThere are lots of other cool features in Google Reader, so I would encourage you to check it out; you've got nothing to lose. I can't tell you how much time it has saved me. Check out the Google Reader Team blog for more info (<a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.com\">http://googlereader.blogspot.com</a>).\n\nHappy RSSificating!","createdDate":"2009-03-03T14:29:48.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-03-03T15:21:45.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:4161","contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","description":"i am also a big fan of Google Reader, for many of the same reasons.

I took all of the student systems that ran under the registrar and brought them together. I found out that just after I left, two major things I was trying to consolidate were completed, and they also announced a permanent CIO that reported to the correct place. I helped them move to a structure that will help them function better in the future.\n\nAnother accomplishment was with regards to a campus-wide email system, similar to the Groupwise Email Initiative work that\u2019s going on here. I got people to buy into an idea, and then got 60% of campus into a central system.\n\n\n<b>Anything you wish you could have done differently?</b>\n\nI wish they\u2019d had the foresight to make changes more rapidly instead of having me in an interim position for four years. It would have been better to make the changes to the CIO\u2019s office, have everyone report to the proper place, and give them the authority to do things\u2014like they\u2019ve done here. It would have been better for the institution. I think this university has made some outstanding decisions in that respect, and of course I got the job, and I like it! I think the direction that NCSU is heading in will be the direction for IT in universities in the future.\n\n\n<b>How important is it for campus to be a proponent of open standards and protocols?</b>\n\nI'm a big believer in having standards and following them. But like everything else, you have to balance the productivity, the cost, the gains, and so on. For example, many email systems contain elements that aren\u2019t standard. Microsoft Exchange, for example, has some nonstandard SMTP and internal exchange for accounts. There are some huge benefits to that, but some of the email doesn\u2019t meet the standards set forth for transfers.\n\nThe Internet Explorer (IE) browser is another example. There was some nonstandard functionality in it, though I think the newer versions have gotten better. The point is that you have to consider what you\u2019re willing to sacrifice to follow standards.\n\nIt\u2019s the same thing with cost and scale. You have to look at its benefits in the bigger picture. My challenge is to get the job done efficiently and effectively . There are people who say, \u201cOpen standards solve everyone's problems.\u201d In reality, they solve a lot of problems, but there are still a lot of open standards that don\u2019t yet solve problems at the enterprise level. They\u2019re getting there, and whenever we can use them in a way that doesn\u2019t hinder us, I\u2019m all for it.\n\n\n<b>Favorite Book?</b>\n\nRight now I'm reading The HERetic\u2019s Daughter, about a girl growing up in Salem, Massachusetts, where the girl\u2019s grandmother saw her mother go through the Salem Witch Trials. I\u2019m also reading about business process change, and how to manage everything associated with it, but that\u2019s not as exciting.\n\n\n<b>What\u2019s on your MP3 player?</b>\n\nI\u2019m a 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s guy, although my daughter tries to keep me a little more current and every once in a while turns me on to a new band. One of the more interesting ones she pointed me to was \u201cGirl Talk.\u201d It\u2019s a guy that does mashups of a bunch of different styles. It\u2019s pretty cool stuff.\n\n\n<b>What RSS feeds do you subscribe to?</b>\n\nI don\u2019t really subscribe to feeds, because my inbox is just too full, and I'm not willing to pull more into it. Nothing is consistent enough that I always want to see it. I still read Slashdot and CNET to see some of the more popular stuff. And I read the Technician and the News &amp; Observer every day to keep current on what\u2019s going on locally.\n\n\n<b>You\u2019re a Blackberry user. Is there a mobile app that you can\u2019t live without?</b>\n\nTwitterberry is really cool. And I'm only a Blackberry user because that\u2019s what gives me the best functionality in our email environment. It\u2019s not perfect, but none of them are. In the past I had a Windows mobile device\u2014a Motorola Q. It had some things I liked better than the Blackberry and some I didn't. The Blackberry is a productivity tool for me; its integration is really nice. I didn\u2019t buy it for its coolness. Lots of folks like the iPhone, but we don\u2019t have the syncing at the level here that I need. I looked at the touchscreen Blackberry and it just isn\u2019t there yet.\n\n\n<b>Coke or Pepsi?</b>\n\nWhichever one is on tap, but I\u2019m not a soda drinker. I\u2019ll drink water. But, I like espresso more than soda.\n\n========================================================\n\nThats it!

Most of the social networking activity I have read says that social networking is not the way to form communities; it\u2019s a way to enhance an existing community\u2019s collaboration. I am fully in favor of using social networking.\n\nI\u2019d like to see how we can use social networks to research activities not only within our campus, but outside of our campus. To see how we can we work with the rest of the UNC system, the Research Triangle area, universities, to collaborate. They are probably looking at the same issues we are with regards to Web hosting, email, ERP systems and student systems. If social networking tools can help these groups communicate to collaborate, then great.\n\nOne thing we have to remember is that a tool is only as good as its application in the right instance. You can\u2019t force social networking activity just because you have a tool. You have to instill social networking into the culture, and then use the tool to help you carry it out.\n\n\n<b>We have members from ECU and UNC-Charlotte on our NCSU Web Developers social network who have helped a lot in our discussions about Web hosting.</b>\n\nThat is the perfect use of a social network. If you have an environment where people are willing to share, it\u2019s great. Higher Education is one of those places where we\u2019re allowed to do that. We don't have trade secrets really. When we open source and share things, we\u2019re not going to make money, but we get better results and oftern more in return. We have open sourced the Virtual Computer Lab (VCL).\n\n<b>Twitter is pretty popular with some of us. You are on it and generally post on your way to meetings. I notice you didn\u2019t join until you came to NCSU. What inspired you to use Twitter, and what have you gotten out of it?</b>\n\nThere were a couple of things I was looking at doing before I left Florida. I wanted to start a blog, and I\u2019d heard about Twitter, which I was interested in, and to me, is just a micro-blogging service. It\u2019s faster turnaround communication vehicle for doing a lot of the same things as blogs. And as I understand it, blogs are dying and Twitter is taking over\u2014at least in the media I\u2019ve been reading.\n\nThese two things were in the back of my mind as potential ways\u2014as one of the leaders of IT\u2014to communicate some of the things going on. For instance, if I tweet that I\u2019m going to a meeting with NetApp or EMC, it can get people following me to think about possibilities and ideas to improve IT on campus. So, I use it as a communication tool to keep people informed about what I\u2019m doing and what I think people in OIT will be interested in.\n\nTwitter can be used as a two-way communication tool, but I'm not using it that way. I could \u201cfollow\u201d people, which I\u2019m not currently doing, and I could look for responses to my tweets, but quite honestly I just don\u2019t have the bandwidth to operate that way. I\u2019m going to use the governance structure and other methods to solicit responses.\n\nMy interest\u2026 I love that stuff, I mean\u2026 I\u2019m a technology fan. If anybody remembers the little HP-100\u2014the first portable clamshell computer with MSDOS, about the size of a calculator\u2014I had one of those, and I had the Palm when it first came out. I love the stuff if it can help, but all too often I\u2019ve found that a technology is \u201cnot quite there\u201d yet, and because it can\u2019t meet my needs, it sits in my drawer. For that reason, I\u2019ve backed off a little when it comes to jumping into things that are fun, things that I\u2019d like to play with, but can\u2019t get the value out of because my time is too crunched. I\u2019m being a little more selective about what I pick up.\n\n\n<b>So, you\u2019re using Twitter to get information out. Staff are using it as a two-way communication vehicle to keep up with what immediate colleagues are doing, as well as groups across campus, the UNC system, and the industry. Do you think that\u2019s a positive thing?</b>\n\nAnything that can get staff to communicate and figure out what\u2019s going on is beneficial. You all have to figure out what works for you. I figured out what works for me based on my style and needs. If all of a sudden you are following 10000 people on Twitter and spending most of your time looking at Twitter without it helping to get your work done, then no, that is not a positive thing.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have Twitter set up such that the people you are connected to are providing value to what you\u2019re doing, or how you\u2019re operating, then I\u2019m all for it. And that goes for a lot of things\u2014daily phone calls, blog postings, focus groups, whatever communication vehicle that doesn\u2019t waste time. I hate information and meetings that are a waste of time. I just don't have that much time, and I want to use it effectively.\n\n===============================================\n\nCheck back tomorrow for the last part of my interview, where Dr. Hoit speaks about his most proud accomplishment from his time at University of Florida, his views on open standards, and what is playing on his MP3 player right now!","createdDate":"2009-02-26T16:05:28.000Z","updatedDate":"2010-02-02T20:07:15.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"Campus Spotlight","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:4031","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","description":"I don't see twitter killing blogging.

So, the problem would work both ways -- I can copy the live site every day to the dev site, but then I'd lose my changes, or when I upload the dev site to the live site, I'd lose the user changes.\n\nI think for now I'll probably just ditch the access logs, since I think WebStats shows the same stuff already, and I can probably \"manually\" add the page counters in node_counters. For newer content, the Admin / Content Management should order the content list by most recently updated, so I can compare that list.

What do you think about this structure, and do you want to change it?</b>\n\nThe reason I have developed the Strategic Operations Plan is to change that culture. You\u2019ll notice that I am involving external people in all of my committees. If you look at the Identity and Access Management team, for example, it\u2019s has people from the colleges, from departments, and people from OIT on it. This is specifically to uncover duplicated or overlapping work. It\u2019s a chance to brainstorm, \u201cYou need Identity Management. We need Identity Management. In most cases, 80% of what we\u2019re doing is common and 20% of what we\u2019re doing is unique. So, let OIT do what\u2019s common and you can have the freedom to customize your 20%.\n\nSo, to generalize this, when there is a product or service that can benifit from scale, we centralize the portion that makes sense for OIT to do, and we collaborate with the partners to build their portion into the product or service. This works best when addressing a campus-wide product or service.\n\nIn situations where only two or three departments or colleges have need for something, things are probably not going to scale. Take collaboration tools for instance. They are not at the level that they are used pervasively on campus. In this type of situation, we want to set up a committee to determine a \u201cstandard for collaboration tools\u201d so we do not grow into a tower of babel. The approach would be for OIT to bring the disparate groups together, find a cost structure that helps them, and perhaps make a collaborative purchase. And then, stay involved as the service grows to see if it gets large enough (pervasive), and if we can identify commonalities that might lead to a standard OIT service.\n\n<b>Do you see OIT being the catalyst to bringing people together?</b>\n\nAbsolutely. My governance view is that some things need to come from the top down and other things thrive with a grassroots approach.\n\nThere are things that I will notice or that will be brought to my attention from a General Administration (GA) or campus wide perspective. These are the top-down things. Typically, I will announce these as initiatives or imperatives and create task forces or bring to committees through which to engage stakeholders in coming up with a proposal for the best solution. These proposals will return for potential changes and then final approval through the appropriate channels.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the grassroots approach. An example of this is what Engineering is doing with an idea for video sharing. They\u2019ve implemented some great solutions, and other people are now interested in the solution. I hope the collaboration gets to the point where everyone starts telling other people, until it gets to the point that OIT can say, \u201cWe\u2019re ready to offer this as an OIT solution or service.\u201d\n\nI expect both the top-down and the grassroots approaches to be based on trust and collaboration. We need to move forward efficiently with the appropriate approach for the given situation.\n\n<b>How do you see centralizing efforts affecting departmental budgets?</b>\n\nMy hope is that it will save departments money. But as I mentioned earlier, some of that freed up capital still has to go towards the departmental function\u2014that idea of, \u201cYou\u2019re doing something for $100, you give me $60 to do that for you, which I can do at that price due to economies of scale, and you keep the $40 to redirect as you see fit to accomplish your mission. Again, it\u2019s that idea of, \u201cIt\u2019s voluntary. I have a great service; you want to purchase my service because it\u2019s good, and cheaper. You benefit. I benefit.\u201d\n\n<b>Currently, the Nelnet campus credit card interface costs the departments a lot of money\u2014thousands of dollars up front. What do you think about making that service free to campus, with perhaps OIT covering the initial cost and the departments covering the transactional fees?</b>\n\nI can\u2019t answer this question completely, as I\u2019m not yet at the level of understanding about it that I\u2019d like to be. However, I can tell you that we\u2019re doing a complete rate review of every service we offer. In the future, we\u2019re all, including our customers, going to be able to see why a particular rate is what it is.\n\nMy understanding is that part of the Nelnet service works statewide, as part of a General Administration (GA) solution, I believe. There is a monthly connector fee for using credit card transactions in general, as well as a per transaction fee like every credit card service in the industry.\n\nSo, if there is a $50 per month fee per connector, then each connector needs to have a fairly high number of transactions in order to keep the overall cost to an effective level because of the overhead. I know groups on campus are using other services, too, so we need to ask ourselves, \u201cIs the Nelnet service for everybody? Should we be hosting Nelnet-like service ourselves? Maybe we have one $50 fee that is spread across everybody using it. Maybe we do a second service for people who need less volume.\u201d\n\nWe need to understand what it would take to develop such an interface. I expect OIT to be able to say to our customers, \u201cWe charge x dollars an hour to develop Web pages, so we could develop an interface for y dollars. If you can do it yourself, you\u2019re more than welcome to do that. We\u2019ll answer simple questions for you, but beyond that, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d We have to find that balance. I expect us to make the rate available, in support of our transparency goal, so that both we and our customers can make informed, consistent decisions.\n\n==============================================\n\nWant to hear more?

Probably 54,000. At least that's my current count.\n\nIf your unfortunate to have to run Windows, then you know how tedious it can be to print screen and then crop the part of the image you want.

Well now you can! (If you think I'm sounding like the Sham Wow guy, just picture me with an unnecessary headset on.)\n\nJing is a tiny app (for Mac OS X and Windows) that allows you to easily take a screen shot (or video!) of part or all of your desktop and then easily upload it to Screencast.com, save it, or copy it. It also lets you do things like highlight a part of your image, add text, or put an arrow pointing to something.

In case you missed it, you can <a href=\"http://ncsuwebdev.ning.com/forum/topics/part-1-my-interview-with-ncsu\">read Part 1 here</a>.\n\n============================================================\n\n<b>Regarding funding, what is your cost recovery approach?</b>\n\nThere are two very different funding approaches in an organization: collecting up front for services, or charging back for services.\n\nCollecting up front can give the illusion of a no-cost option, but nothing is free\u2014somebody has to pay for it. It\u2019s just that in this approach, central funding covers the cost of services that are shared out as required by your customers. In most cases you have to place limits on the services with this approach.\n\nThe opposite approach is to charge back for services rendered. This approach also requires operating in a cost-effective way; closest to scale; and reducing costs over time, which increases trust in your service; and in a way that customers use their funds to pay per use for a service they are happy with. A couple of examples of this are telephones and networking. We have telephone system infrastructure costs, and we do our best to keep those costs very reasonable for what you get. Compared to Time Warner\u2019s Road Runner services, our networking costs are cheap, providing 100M to the desktop and up to 1G in some places. So for the services we\u2019re offering, the prices are really good. I think we\u2019re very efficient at that and we are at scale.\n\nAnother service that we provide using the up-front approach is our Enterprise Resource Planning service. Everyone gets access to the ERP systems and they pay that centrally. We build the system, and they use it as much as they need to, since it\u2019s a universal and critical business operation.\n\nDepending on the use of the service and the cost, you can work in between these two extreme approaches.\n\nA model that I\u2019ve used in the past and that has worked well works like this, using email at the University of Florida as an example. We\u2019re moving to the GroupWise system and it costs a certain amount to get built, which we\u2019ll do as cost-efficiently as possible. Once it\u2019s built, we\u2019ll be able to calculate what the cost is per user. As the user base grows, that cost will come down, approaching some very reasonable cost when scaled to our entire campus.\n\nThen, we can go to departments and say, \"Look, you\u2019re running a mail server that costs you $3000, which every three years or so you have to replace or upgrade and buy software and antivirus protection for. You also have to have someone manage it for you, which costs x dollars, and you might only have 500 users on it. Looking at your cost per user, you\u2019re spending the same, or up to five times what we\u2019ll spend, and our service is enterprise-wide with redundant systems, backup, 24x7 service and professionally managed. So let\u2019s make a deal\u2014save some of your money by giving us 60% of your budget for this service and the remaining 40% you can put to use in producing your core work or services; and we\u2019ll provide your email service.\u201d So, it\u2019s a trade where we get the resources to offer the service at reasonable costs, and they get a return of some of their support dollars to use toward other needs\u2014and everybody wins. The key is that we can scale the service and they can\u2019t, because there is no way a service scaled at a college or department level can compete with one scaled at a campus level.\n\nIn order for this model to work, the system has to be opt-in. We can\u2019t force people to join. They need to join in because they see value in it\u2014value at an equivalent or reduced cost for the same service they currently have. Another requirement for the success of this model is that our service be excellent. It has to be outstanding and at or above a performance level that they are expecting.\n\n<b>A quoted question from one of our members: \"My local team is finding incredible success with the idea of \"radical transparency\": that is, our meeting notes, our project planning, our team's activity stream, source code, and so on, are completely in the open\u2014open either to the world or to the thousands of account holders we have across the land-grant system. There's a historical fear in Higher Education IT\u2014I\u2019ve held the fear myself\u2014that being open with your work and processes will lead to a breakdown in expectation management, that people will misread your work as an \"official, coming project,\" for instance, or that such openness will lead to too much questioning by people about your work. We've found the complete opposite to be true. It has increased our productivity dramatically. Would this type of model work for the NC State IT community and OIT? Do you see a benefit in this model? What can we do as a campus to put more of our activity, work, and planning in the open in real-time?\"</b>\n\nIf you look at our Strategic Operations Plan, we\u2019ve used the words \u201cpervasive transparency.\u201d One of our goals is to do exactly what you\u2019re talking about, with some caveats. I believe transparency is critical\u2014that people need to get support, collaborate with each other, and take advantage of the benefit that having visibility to each other\u2019s work can bring. I have asked all of OIT to make our meeting notes and cost structures available on the Web.\n\nI haven\u2019t given thought yet to going as far as making interim source code available to people, but I\u2019ll certainly include that in my thought process going forward. Making that kind of work available is critical, particularly in areas such as Extension, because they need to know what\u2019s going on in order to feel like part of the team. We can do this with web conferencing, and it\u2019ll probably have to be video web conferencing, especially with our ongoing travel and budget restraints.\n\nThe idea of \u201cradical transparency\u201d is kind of interesting. I would be willing to try that on a project to see how it affects it. There are some things that I'm hesitant to do that with because of security concerns. Web hosting, I would have no concerns over. But doing that with our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) process, for instance, I\u2019d be a little more hesitant about. However, I am not hesitant about putting a diverse group of people on a team to collaborate more, and making minutes and milestones related to their work available on the Web.\n\nTransparency is one of our goals. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to take it to the extent described in the question, but I\u2019m certainly willing to pilot it on a sample project.\n\n============================================================\n\nPart 3 of my interview will be posted tomorrow.

Sorry about that.\n\nThere was a period of time in the last few years, where every set of meeting notes I wanted to look at (those few that actually showed up available to campus) was stuck behind WRAP. I'm trying to find an example, but can't at the moment (I thought the <a href=\"http://www.ncsu.edu/it/uitc/\">UITC work</a> was once behind an authentication wall, but my memory appears flawed). Maybe it's not a problem anymore, and all of that information is slowly swinging back into the open again).\n\nThat actually has nothing to do with WRAP - and I should have written \"restricted to University account holders only\" - WRAP is just easier to say that (but, hey, not that I've ever shirked away from verbosity before, why start now? :-)\n\nMy point was mainly that it's absurd to stick most meeting notes and announcements behind an University-account only authentication wall like that. It's an impediment to producing and getting feeds of content updates (protected feeds have never really worked and usually boil down to just using some kind of unique hashkey in the url) and it just throws up an unnecessary roadblock to getting information.\n\nIf there's a real need for auth wall protections, split the data output, Sysnews is a decent model of information splitting here, it's a combination open+authenticated information feed, which is fine, I can understand some of the technical details staying behind an auth wall, but it's very useful to have a feed of the public details of that.\n\nSorry, I was pretty unclear.\n\nHowever, since you mention it, WRAP could probably be opened just fine. (I have no opinion of whether it should or shouldn't, however, it probably will never be, because there's a truckload of University Intellectual Property history that comes along with it)\n\nThe core of WRAP is cryptographically strong public/private key protection. I don't think I ever looked at the code that closely, but the people that created it here on campus and continue to maintain it are some of the most conscientious developers I've met. So I'm sure it could withstand public scrutiny. It's certainly a whole lot better than most of the auth protocols used in off-the-shelf open source software - and I bet very serious money it's better than many of the proprietary authentication buried in some the of the commercial software we get.\n\nKerberos is open source (and open protocol). Shibboleth is open source (and open protocol). OpenID (not a paradigm of high security, but good enough for most of the web) is open source and open protocol. So I don't buy your perfect example. And what would be vulnerable? OMG we might release what? Some departmental memos? Please.\n\nDo we have data that needs protecting at this university? Yes, but nowhere near what we do. And that's a continuing conversation that I'll have to reserve for a later verbose posting :-)","createdDate":"2009-03-03T15:07:12.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:4141","contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","description":"When we do talk about actual security, a whitelist of allowed users is much better than a blacklist of \"problem IPs\". With the \"opportunities\" of cross-site scripting, SQL injection and arbitrary code execution, complex applications are open to a much higher level of scrutiny (that of those who enjoy stealing University quality Internet connections). By whitelisting users (through the use of WRAP), you limit the attack vector to a known quantity. Additionally, if it is open for all, it might be considered a \"University website\" with all the rights and restrictions granted thereunto. This could mean a lot of work making something accessible even though the actual users of the system do not have the associated accessibility needs.\n\nI'll admit that I'm playing devil's advocate in this last point, but these can be legitimate concerns for individuals who are trying to do their job without running afoul of University guidelines or malicious users.\n\nThe point is that while I value open access to information, there is always some risk involved. Whether that risk is worth the openness (open standards for encryption) or just means you'll get burned (broken hashing / encryption algorithms) all depends on the quality of the design.\n\nYou brought up the example of WRAP, and I think that is perfect. Last I checked, not everyone (in the world) can download WRAP. However, it has a lot of value that the world could benefit from. If it were open, how long do you think it would stay secure? If it did not stay secure, how many applications might become vulnerable? Would they need to be shut down? How long would they stay disabled? How difficult would it be to design a new solution which maintains the functionality but resolves the security issue that was being exploited? How do we ensure that there isn't still a way to exploit the new design? How much does this all cost? How long are we going to be unable to do our job while this process is going on?\n\nThe core infrastructure has a lot of dependent pieces. We saw with the global DNS exploit how even SSL is insecure and it still isn't completely resolved. However, the value of openness is ever present, though it can be an expensive and risky proposition.

The interview will be split into several posts. I will be posting additional parts of the interview throughout the week, so make sure you check back to continue the interview.\n\n\nPart 1 of My Interview with NCSU CIO, Dr. Marc Hoit\n========================================================\n\n<b>We've elected a new president and he is evaluated on his first 100 days in office. I\u2019m curious as to how you think your first 100 days have gone.</b>\n\nI'm really happy with them. As an organization, we devised a Strategic Operations Plan (SOP) and there is already feedback coming in from campus that they are happy with the interactions, collaborations and directions of OIT. So my goals for the first 100 days have worked out well.\n\n<b>And the next 100 days?</b>\n\nIn the next 100 days, I want to turn the SOP into actions, making sure everyone operates according to that plan and truly internalizes the goals and strategies, using them as the way to do business. A perfect example of this is OIT\u2019s Web Hosting Committee, which has set up communication channels to involve everyone using our Web hosting services in telling us how we can help them do what they need to do. This is what I\u2019d like to see all of OIT do.\n\nMy plan for the next 12 months will be focused on governance. Our Governance structure should help address two common frustrations in large organizations: 1) communication issues and 2) a process to solicit and encourage input\u2014both toward how decisions are made in the organization, and creating and improving the processes in which the organization works. Again, the Web Hosting Committee is a good example of what we need to do. It\u2019s not enough to have ideas of what we should do or what industry is doing. We need to take the required step, as web did, to make sure that it fits the needs of our University. They did this by bringing together interested parties on campus to devise a proposal that considers: what the interested parties\u2014such as other central units on campus\u2014need, what OIT can efficiently and cost-effectively provide, and the strategic future direction of the industry. This resulted in a jointly-developed proposal on how to do Web Hosting at N.C. State, along with an opportunity to improve the plan and make a recommendation as to who should approve it.\n\nThat is just one of a hundred things we need to be doing. So, governance is a critical part of helping us to operate as an organization with shared goals\u2014so people know where to bring their questions and how to get projects done and work together.\n\n<b>Speaking of Web hosting, currently students are allotted www4 space. How is the Web Hosting Services Pilot going to affect that?</b>\n\nI don't know. I am hoping that an evaluation of the Web Hosting Services Pilot will give us that answer. Concurrently, our Student Email Initiative is evaluating products that come with Web space. At one extreme, we could have a student Web space (for personal home pages, for instance) solution that is externally operated and managed.\n\n<b>Similar to Google sites?</b>\n\nExactly. In addition to Google Apps Education Edition, we\u2019re considering Microsoft Live@edu/Exchange Labs for a student email solution, and it, too, includes Web space in its package. Yahoo\u2019s Zimbra includes an option to get a MySite at yahoo.com. And you get to brand these however you\u2019d like to. So that is one extreme of the possibility, one which would incorporate some hosting space within our student email solution.\n\nThe other extreme involves internally building a hosting solution, offering it at very good rate, and somehow finding a mechanism to pay for it. In building the solution, we\u2019d have to consider storage requirements, what we currently offer, and what new requirements the students might have. Then, as an example of finding a way to fund it, we might approach a department or college to say, \u201cStudents get this percentage of the service automatically, and maybe student government or student fees could fund the rest.\u201d\n\nIn reality, we would probably end up somewhere between those extremes. Student organizations are using the OrgSync product, which includes Web hosting. Others are already using Google sites and have their own presence. Student organizations do have some funding, and there may be some interest by Student Affairs in subsidizing their Web space to have sites that better fit campus needs. So, that\u2019s why we might end up somewhere in between those extreme options.\n\nOne of my biggest concerns is about the cost constraints under which we\u2019re working. As you look across industry, Web hosting services are offering unlimited storage and bandwidth for $5.95 a month. You can drop a Drupal instance or a Wordpress instance in there, use a C-panel interface and have a hosting environment for $60 per year. However, you do have to be knowledgeable enough to manage the environment and update the software. The other extreme is that for around $2.35 per month, you can get a limited number of pages in a truly content-managed site, pick a template, type your information into forms, and have 20 or 30 static pages and build a site very easily\u2014without having to manage anything. This type of offering is possible for Web hosting services companies because they can operate at scale. They have thousands of sites and people to set up the automated software and they do all the virtual hosting\u2014and because of that, they can do it at a cost that is pretty inexpensive.\n\nIf OIT were going to host, we would need a comparable approach, which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the same cost. While they supposedly serve at unlimited access speeds, we\u2019d be doing it at 1-gig access speeds and providing enterprise-level storage and backup. We may end up offering a system that would be comparable to industry\u2019s $100 per month package, so we need to be careful with what we compare. We need to start our offering at a cost that is reasonable, and one for which we have the resources to support, while providing value that is evident to our customers.\n\nWe have some important things to consider. For example, we have to protect most student data, so hosting it ourselves may be the only answer. Or it might turn out that we can achieve that security with a hosted rack that a vendor provides more cheaply, because they can operate at scale and we can\u2019t. Email systems are another example of where scaling is a factor. It takes about 15,000 users to be able to cover all of the up-front costs of hardware and software needed to install a system. You have to consider all of these things in your decisions to see what\u2019s sensible\u2014in the case of Web hosting as well as student email, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in our Web Hosting Services Pilot and our Student Email Initiative.\n\n========================================================\n\nCheck back tomorrow for Part 2 of the interview, where I speak with Dr. Hoit about Cost Recovery and the idea of \"Radical Transparency\".","createdDate":"2009-02-23T13:49:56.000Z","updatedDate":"2010-02-02T20:06:21.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"Campus Spotlight","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:3825","contributorName":"3p7bzgj31hmap","description":"I think it'd be a great idea to give students the option to manage their own Wordpress instance as their personal space.

It's too big. When something that \"shouldn't ever happen\" does happen, it shuts down way too many services.\n\nSometime around 12:30 am this morning, AFS stopped working. I was paged in to check on the courses websites at 1:45, when they started showing signs that something was amiss.\n\nA quick lesson in basic AFS: The AFS directory structure is a collection of volumes. Each volume is a piece of the file system, it usually contains a top level directory, some sub directories, and some mount points for other volumes. The volumes are stored on the various AFS file servers. The VLDB (volume location database) is maintained on a set of database servers. This database contains all the points that map the volume names/ids to the locate the volume data on the file servers.\n\nA simple command like \"cd /afs/unity/users/b/brabec\" results in a long list of lookups behind the scenes:\n- VLDB lookup /afs/unity\n- retrieve the root volume for unity from a fileserver\n- look inside, find that the users directory is a mount for the users volume\n- VLDB lookup for the user volume\n- retrieve the users volume from a fileserver\n- look inside, find that the b directory is another volume mount\n- and so on...\n\nSo the \"Very Bad Thing\" that happened in the wee hours of this morning, was the three database servers somehow fumbled the VLDB between them, and corrupted it beyond recovery. We're not sure what happened to do this. Theories include problems with mixing v1.2 DB servers with v1.4 fileservers, and possible network interruptions that were evident while trying to fix the problem. Regardless of the cause, once the VLDB was trashed, none of our AFS unity volumes could be located on the file servers. The only thing that saved us for a time was the cached copies of a lot of those lookups did not expire very quickly. But anytime a server or client tried to find something that was not saved in cache, it could not proceed.\n\nThe fix was to erase the VLDB and then survey all of the unity file servers to find all of the volumes and get their entries back into the database. That took a lot of time, on the order of 6 hours even with 3-4 servers being polled in parallel for most of the time.\n\nMeanwhile, the cache that saved us on some servers, also made the problem worse on others. Servers that didn't know where to find volumes would do a lookup, the VLDB would tell them the volume didn't exist, and they'd cache that result. Once the VLDB was rebuilt we had to reboot all of our Solaris based web servers to make sure they weren't saving these bad results.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the second time this particular \"Very Bad Thing\" has happened to us in recent months. The last time the database was corrupted but recoverable, but systems still had to spend a lot of time tracking down and restoring missing/bad entries. It would be naive of us to assume it won't happen again.\n\nSome fixes are in the works:\n- upgrade the database servers and other remaining AFS servers to the 1.4.x software\n- keep a 7 day history of the VLDB database file, to provide checkpoints that may be used for faster recovery in the event of another corruption.\n- and of course, give serious consideration to splitting web things off of AFS where it is no longer needed.","createdDate":"2009-02-21T00:01:04.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-02-25T15:08:36.000Z","approved":"Y","groupId":"2486881:Group:859","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:3924","contributorName":"19wgwss45yepg","description":"Jason Edgecombe at UNCC contacted me and passed this problem along to Derrick Brashear at openafs.org.

This is necessary because there is the potential that a \"contributer\" could mistakenly open up Dreamweaver and connect and cause some problems, or even worse, open up the J drive to one of our sites and cause havoc.</li>\n<li>Each major department or unit has a kind of content master - a person who oversees all content and ensures that pages are being updated and that content is correct and of good quality.</li>\n<li>We are in the beginning stages of experimenting with the open source CMS known as Drupal.

At one point on our lab machines if you looked in the root you would see AFS cells for CMU, MIT, UMICH, and other universities as well as some companies. But over time there was little use of that sort of thing so it was phased out on our standard environments. Nowadays it makes things much slower for little benefit.\n\nThe \"root\" of AFS (/afs on *nix or J:\\ on Windows) is constructed in different ways, like using a config file (CellServDB) that simply lists all of the AFS cells (or just some of them), or it can be pulled from DNS or a combination of the 2, or it can be handed out as a volume by your \"home cell\".

There's barely any learning curve, unless you have never heard of a radio button list (select one), or check box list (select many).\n\nYou can find the full list of features on the LimeSurvey site, but a few of my favorites are:\n\n* Unlimited number of surveys open at the same time\n* Unlimited number of questions in a survey (only limited by your database)\n* Unlimited number of participants to a survey\n* User-Management\n* 20 different question types with more to come\n* WYSIWYG HTML Editor\n* Integration of pictures and movies into a survey\n* Creation of a printable survey version\n* Conditions for questions depending on earlier answers (Skip Logic / Branching)\n* Re-usable editable answer sets\n* Ready-made importable questions\n* Survey expiry dates for automation\n* Enhanced import and export functions to text, CSV, PDF, SPSS, queXML and MS Excel format\n* Basic statistical and graphical analysis with export facility\n\n\nThe conditional question feature is possibly my favorite, just because its such a time saver. IE: If you answered A,B, or D in question 1, then display question 2, otherwise, skip question 2 and go to question 3. It really is as simple as point and click survey creation.\n\nThe more complex features may take a little while longer to become accustomed to, like using tokens for sending survey invitations via email merge. This is so you can track who has responded (and what they answered), and who has not responded yet.\n\nWhile setting up the survey can take a significant amount of time, you usually will spend longer on the analysis of the data collected. LimeSurvey does a fantastic job of making it both easy to get quick stats on the data, or exporting it for use in another program (SPSS anyone?).\n\nI could go on forever about much time it has saved me, but that would just waste more of the time you need to create your old fashioned surveys. So quit reading this, and go start using LimeSurvey. Your first survey can be to ask your users how much they like the ability to create their own surveys, and not have to rely on a break in your schedule.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/117-questions1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/118-questions1.png?width=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"177\"/></a></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/119-questions2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/120-questions2.png?width=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"140\"/></a></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/121-questions3.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/122-questions3.png?width=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"74\"/></a></p>","createdDate":"2009-02-17T14:46:03.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-02-18T20:11:57.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:3589","contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","description":"I have not used surveybuilder before --- i'll defer to the group for more information on that comparison.","createdDate":"2009-02-18T20:11:57.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:3584","contributorName":"1x58sgozterf4","description":"We've used it on a client by client basis.

Well, I have us 2 possibilities, but nothing set in stone yet.\n\nI am working with our campus Apple rep to get Steve Hayman, the CE of Mobility, to come give us an overview of iPhone development, combined with some how-to's. Right now, we are still working out logistics, but it looks like it will take place on March 19th here on campus. The workshop will be in conjunction with some folks from UNC and Duke, so we are trying to work out how it will work. What it looks like now is that we will do a half-day session for NCSU people, then the UNC and Duke people will do the other half-day session. We haven't determined if we are going to do it in the morning or afternoon yet, but I wanted to let you folks know so you could get it on your calendar.\n\nThe second option is a little different. Everette Allen was contacted by a commercial training unit that does iPhone development classes for a fee. They have a 5 day iPhone dev workshop that costs about $3000/person for the standard rate. They offered to come here to teach what would amount to the first day of that 5 day class for &lt; $100 per person. We are trying to work with them to see if they will give us a discount off the rest of the $3000 to continue the class, because frankly $3k for an iPhone class is out of reach for pretty much everyone on campus. In fact, the $100 may be out of reach, but that is the point of this. They would like an estimate of who would participate in the workshop if they did it, so would anyone be interested? I know our group would still likely do the $100 class, but beyond that who knows. I'm not asking anyone to commit to it, just post if you are interested. We do not have a date for this yet, but it would likely be a few weeks after the free on-campus iPhone class...so late March early April.\n\nEither way, I am working on ways to get us some exposure to iPhone development classes, including looking at licensing for the University for iPhone development.","createdDate":"2009-02-11T17:42:49.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-02-11T18:05:56.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"Web Programming","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:3357","contributorName":"36mexpty3zftm","description":"I'm definitely interested!","createdDate":"2009-02-11T18:05:56.000Z"}]},{"id":"2486881:Topic:3308","contributorName":"3h8vedhr1e7gr","title":"Boxee: TV Ouside the Box","description":"<b>Best Thing Ever! (this week): Boxee</b>\nWebsite: <a href=\"http://boxee.tv/\">http://boxee.tv/</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.boxee.tv/\">http://blog.boxee.tv/</a>\n\n<b>See the Video Demo here: <a href=\"http://ncsuwebdev.ning.com/video/boxeedemo-1\">http://ncsuwebdev.ning.com/video/boxeedemo-1</a></b>\n\n\nBoxee is cross-platform media center software. Similar in many ways to the open source X-Box media center XBMC (Boxee is actually built off it) this software will allow you to organize all your media in one place and makes it easily accessible. But don't think that Boxee is just a rip-off of XBMC; it's marketed as the \"first ever social media center\" since among its other fantastic features is the ability for users to have \"friends\". Use their website to find or invite your friends and their information will appear when you login. You can follow what they've watched recently, their likes, dislikes and recommendations through the Boxee interface.\n\nBoxee also scores big with its network options. It connects with IMDB (Internet Movie Database) and TVDB (figure it out) to give you thumbnails and reviews of videos and AMG for album art. It comes with a built-in BitTorrent client and can stream your video with Windows File-Sharing and XBMSP (X-Box protocol). It can also export a users activity to Twitter and other social networking tools, though it doesn't yet pull those feeds back into the Boxee interface. Boxee is built primarily in C++ but a Python plug-in system allows content \"channels\" from the web (one of Boxee's best features). Boxee uses XMBC's reputably easy-to-use GUI toolkit for designing themes so look for lots of skinning options to be available.\n\n\nStart up Boxee and you'll be asked to login. Initial set-up is super-easy: start on their website and create an account to get going, then just follow the instructions. Once you're logged in Boxee pretty much takes over. It will look on recognized drives, in designated folders for video, music and pictures.\n\n<b>Music</b>\nFor the music segments, Boxee will find any cover art available, and organizes by album and artist. If you don't see CD you expected, use the \"Browse' section to wander through any of your networked machines, connected devices, etc. Finally, if you want to expand your horizons you can use the \"Internet\" section to browse free music and Podcasts available online through sites like BBC, NPR, last.fm and a few others.\n\n<b>Pictures</b>\nAs with your music, Boxee will go looking in the obvious places for pictures. Anything in your \"Pictures\" folder should show up, and the folder structure remains which makes it a little easier to navigate. Again, if you're missing something use the \"Browse\" section to go looking for your shots. Is your best stuff online? Connect to Flicker, Picasa or \"The Big Picture\" to find your shots, and anything your friends have available as well. I admit to having some troubles getting to online pictures, but this thing is in Alpha so I'll let it go...\n\n<b>Video</b>\nThe Video options are by far the most impressive section on Boxee. As with Music and Photos, Boxee will find anything you've got to start with but the \"Browse\" options will let you seek out additional files or those added later. Boxee separates video files into \"Movies\" and \"TV Shows\". It also has an 'Internet' section and here is where the fun begins. Connections are available to 18 \"channels\" including CBS, Comedy Central, BBC, CNN, MTV and best of all, Joost and Hulu. Dozens of shows and movies are at your fingertips here, which is especially exciting for those who haven't caught up on their 'Remington Steele' and 'Doogie Howser M.D.' episodes (you know you're excited!).\nThe 'Internet' section also includes a connection to Netflix. If you're a member (and really, who isn't?) you can login and view your queue. If you've got anything in your Instant Queue you can watch it through Boxee, though it's only as good as your network connection. Rumor has it that the Netflix options are unavailable on Apple TV and Linux for the time being.\n\n<b>More</b>\nBoxee will let you interface with your profile and see what your friends are up to and whether or not they're online. Boxee also has some exceptionally flexible options to play with in the 'Settings' including your region (for weather info from weather.com) your background, screen saver, navigation sounds, controls, etc. Finally there is a \"Download\" section which apparently includes a built-in BitTorrent client. Can't give accurate info on this since all my attempts to play (and by \"play\" I mean download only completely legal files) have caused Boxee to crash for me.\n\nSo you want it, right? Currently Boxee is in Alpha. It was released for the Mac (Leopard, Tiger), Apple TV and Linux machines with Intel processors in June of 2008. An Alpha version for Windows was released in January of 2009 but is currently invitation-only. Rumor has it that they plan to release a Boxee box sometime this year. Keep an eye on their blog (<a href=\"http://blog.boxee.tv/\">http://blog.boxee.tv/</a>): its updated regularly and they're very good about soliciting feedback and talking to their audience.

Hmm.. uhh.. can\u2019t seem to find it. Oh well, gone forever it is. Or is it? With Delicious you\u2019ll never lose anything ever again. Here\u2019s that link: <a href=\"http://lib.rario.us/\">http://lib.rario.us/</a> (one of my first bookmarks I ever saved, back in 2006).\n\nOkay, so the link itself is not the point I\u2019m trying to make, it\u2019s the fact that I have it and that I can retrieve it quickly. Delicious is an online service that is typically billed as social bookmarking and it is only one example of this kind of service (see <a href=\"http://www.google.com/bookmarks/\">Google Bookmarks</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stumbleupon.com/\">StumbleUpon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.furl.net/\">Furl</a>, and <a href=\"http://digg.com/\">Digg</a>). And maybe Delicious isn't the very newest or sexiest service out there, but very few things on the Web have stuck with me like Delicious has. There are a plethora of Web 2.0 apps/services out there, and I find it refreshing to have one that does one thing very well. The only thing that would make it better is if more people used it, just like any Web 2.0 app. Hence, this posting :-).\n\nThe way it works is pretty simple, just watch <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x66lV7GOcNU\">this simplistic little demonstration</a>. Thank you <a href=\"http://www.commoncraft.com/\">Common Craft</a> for yet another fantastic and simple tutorial! (aside: talk about \u201cbest thing ever\u201d that could easily be applied to Lee LeFever\u2019s Plain English series). So, you get the idea: go to a Web page, tag it using the Firefox browser plugin, have it forever, automatically share it with everyone, etc. Now that you know how this works, here\u2019s what I really love about it.\n\n<b>My Internet Library</b>\n<a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/128-20090203_1407.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/129-20090203_1407.png?width=250\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"207\" style=\"float: right;\"/></a>\n\nThe greatest thing about Delicious is universal access to my folksonomically organized bookmarks. Might sound like a mouthful, but it's all a little too easy and obvious. So, instead of being restricted to folders on a single browser for organizing my bookmarks, I can choose to associate any Web page with as many \"keywords\" (called tags) as I want, after all nothing ever fits neatly into one and only one category does it? Plus, there's no having to deal with the hassle of exporting/importing bookmarks from browser to browser, it's all right there at <a href=\"http://delicious.com/cdmorris\">http://delicious.com/cdmorris</a> (insert your username at cdmorris). At the time of writing this posting, I've made 821 bookmarks. Can you imagine storing that all in a browser? No way. If you could imagine that though, could you imagine finding anything? With Delicious you can start searching for something by looking through your tags. So your thought process might go something like this.. \"Ok I know I found a great web design resource the other day, some kind of background generator tool.. hmm\" and then you'd look through your tags for \"design\" and \"tools\" and <a href=\"http://delicious.com/cdmorris/design+tools\">find it there</a>.\n\nFor me, the real useful tools are the ones that save me time in my everyday life. I want tools that save me steps and shave seconds off of any task. I can't stand having to go back through the dark recesses of my mind to try and figure out the correct Google search string that brought me to the page I found the other day. So, whenever I find something I find useful, I tag it with Delicious and add it to my ever-growing personal Internet library.\n\n<b>My Network</b>\n\nI've established that Delicious makes my life easier by providing me with a catalog of organized links, but the real value definitely is the social aspect - enter \"your network.\" As any of you are familiar, with any social website, you can add friends - or \"fans\" as they are technically called in Delicious. For me, I'm fans of some of my old co-workers, teachers I've had in the past and industry experts. Via RSS I recieve a stream of all new bookmarks that each one of them makes (I use Google Reader here). And now I can get the very latest on what other people are finding interesting or valuable. This helps me stay up-to-date professionally in some cases and in other cases its good for a laugh.\n\n<b>Nice little tool, but...</b>\n\nDon't get me wrong. I know the title of this blog/discussion forum is \"Best Thing Ever\" and I really do love Delicious, but.. there are so many other services out there that decrease it's potential. For example, there's Digg, which is like a specialized version of Delicious focusing on news and articles. Then there's Twitter which some users employ to send out links to each other (ephemeral though they may be). And there's also Google Reader, which has it's Share function. My gripe here is that there are too many options, too many ways to do the same thing, which means we're all missing out on the full potential of the Web.\n\nMy next post on this forum might be regarding a convergence tool like <a href=\"http://friendfeed.com\">FriendFeed</a>, <a href=\"http://www.noovo.com\">NooVo</a> or <a href=\"http://zannel.com\">Zannel</a>, after all <a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/10_ways_social_media_will_change_in_2009.php\">I hear that is one the ways social media will change this year...</a>\n\nps. if you are on Delicious already my username is cdmorris, feel free to follow me or to let me know your account and I can grow my network!","createdDate":"2009-02-03T20:29:37.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-12-14T20:06:11.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:3351","contributorName":"3p7bzgj31hmap","description":"Fascinating, delicious bookmarking of emails.... that could be useful.

Part of my responsibilities is to be the Contribute Administrator of for the (AFS based) Web sites that OIT-OCC-DEO supports (quite a few of them). Some large(30+ users), others smaller and a lot with only one or two users.\n\nNow that Contribute CS4 is available, and some of the clients either installing it or will soon be ordering it, I wanted to install it on my computer (PC).\n\nTo begin with, I provide instructions to clients on how to obtain and install Contribute.\nSo, this looked like a good time to update those procedures.\n\nI updated the procedures and began to test them.\n\nThe download (of Contribute CS4) went great.\n\nThe install started smoothly. However, during the download, a pop up asked me if I wanted to allow earlier versions of Contribute to be used. I checked the Yes box. The remainder of the install continued to a successful conclusion. I closed Contreibute CS4. Happy that my instruction worked.\n\nA little while later, I received a message form a client saying that she was trying to use Contribute (CS3) to update some web pages, but got a message (on the yellow message bar) that said the the connection was no longer valid.\n\nI started up my Contribute CS3 and found out that my key based connections were also no longer valid.\n\nLater that day (and continuing), more calls came in form other users that also were getting the message that the the same message - their connections were no longer valid.\n\nAfter conducting some research, we found out that other people had reported the same problem and that an apparent solution was to: 1) disable all administrative functions in Contribute CS4 (I did and I also removed CS4 from my computer), and 2) have clients re-install their connection keys.\n\nUsing Contribute CS3, I sent clients connection keys along with instructions on how to install them. That worked.\n\nNow, I have to make sure that all of my remaining clients re-install their connection keys.\n\nAs the tee shirts say - \"Life is good\".\n\n\nToday, I received the following additional information:\n\nIts from:\n<a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Contribute/5.0_Using/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d1180fba3730-7c33.html\">http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Contribute/5.0_Using/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d1180fba3730-7c33.html</a>\n\nAnd says:\nEnable compatibility with older versions of Contribute\n\nComments (0)\nContribute offers administrators two compatibility options\u2014one that allows users with earlier versions to work on the website, and one that does not:\n\nTransition mode\nIn this mode, users of earlier versions of Contribute can continue working on the website, along with Contribute 4.0 and later users.

After my (painful) visit, I am trying to schedule an appointment for 6 months away. The lady behind the counter picks a day, and my first thought it \"Wait, lemme check my calendar to make sure I don't have anything scheduled\". So I whip out my fancy schmancy, brand spankin' new iPhone, and click on the calendar icon. March -&gt; 12 -&gt; 2009. Nothing on there, must be free! \"Sign me up,\" I say. So I put my appointment on my calendar on my iPhone, get home, sync up my phone, and whaddaya know? I have a meeting on that day, and therefore can't go to the dentist. A rousing story of phone tag and reschedule attempts followed, but you get the gist of the story.\n\nIf you have been using iPhone without Neuvasync, this story probably sounds familiar.\n\nBy default, iPhone can't do over-the-air syncing with a calendar (whether its on iCal on your computer, or GCal) unless you have it setup with an Exchange server, unless you want to pay for MobileMe. Since I don't have access to an Exchange server, and I didn't want to drop $99/year for MobileMe, I was stuck with syncing my calendars whenever I synced my phone with my computer. That is until i discovered Neuvasync.\n\n<img src=\"discussions/131-ipod_cal.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"510\" style=\"float: right;\"/>\nNeuvasync allows you to masquerade your Google Calendar as a Microsoft Exchange server. So what does that mean exactly? It means that if you create an appointment on your phone, it will automatically push that appointment to your Google Calendar. It also means that if you put an appointment on Google Calendar, it will push back to your phone.\n\nInstantly, your calendar application on your iPhone becomes useful without MobileMe or Exchange! No more waiting to sync when you get home. No more scheduling meetings over one another. It's really the best thing for the iPhone since...well...the iPhone.\n\nNeuvasync also added a new feature in the last week or so that supports colors for calendars, meaning if you have more than one Google calendar setup for your account, they show up in different colors on your iPhone!\n\nDon't have an iPhone? Neuvasync works with a variety of other devices, including some Windows Mobile devices!\n\nAs far as setup is concerned, it was easy as pie. Neuvasync provides detailed instructions on granting access to your Google Calendar, then getting it setup on your phone. The only caveat was that when setting up your phone to use an Exchange server, it will delete all your existing appointments that are currently on your phone. That's an Apple thing, not a Neuvasync thing, so other phones may have different results.\n\nNeuvasync really has changed the way I use my mobile phone. Even though this isn't a \"web development\" related service, it sure has made me more efficient, which carries over into other parts of my life. So check out Neuvasync if you haven't already. Your dentist receptionist will thank you later :)","createdDate":"2009-01-27T12:56:54.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-01-27T12:57:27.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!"},{"id":"2486881:Topic:2648","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","title":"Help!

At the same time, I also seem to be among the few who still test IE6 and make sure to get most of my web tools working for it.\n\nThe reasons are two-fold: First, on my own public facing website, my browser report over the past month comes out to:\nInternet Explorer - 61.17%\nFirefox - 25.97%\nOpera - 7.35%\nSafari - 2.41%\nChrome - 2.36%\n\nOf that 61% IE traffic, 33% is still IE6; so basically, around 20% IE6 users. Considering that is barely lower than my Firefox percentage, and almost double the combination of the other 3 browsers, it's a hard demographic to ignore.\n\nOn the ECE homepage (a much, much smaller sample which I think is heavily skewed by all the testing we do on the page), we get:\nInternet Explorer 46.32%\nFirefox 41.62%\nChrome 4.96%\nSafari 4.01%\n\nWith 27% of the IE traffic being IE6, so 12% total viewership by my math. At the end of the day, I don't see how you can say \"let me cater to Chrome and Safari, instead of IE6, when both are much less popular\". That's just my point of view; and I don't expect many to share it. I'm still jaded against non-IE browsers after the hell that was Netscape 4.7.\n\nThe second reason is that primarily when I develop, I start doing so in IE6. IE6 is almost a common ancestor to every modern browser in that when each of these newer browsers came out they HAD to render the pages that IE6 could, otherwise they never would've gained any marketshare. So if you start all your pages there, it tends to make it easier to branch it out to Firefox and IE7, rather than going from Firefox to IE7 then trying to work in IE6. You'll still be able to make your pages compliant and validate, but I generally find myself using CSS hacks and tricks a lot less.\n\nThen again, I've been developing in IE6 for about 10 years now, so I'm sort of used to all it's little idiosyncrasies.","createdDate":"2009-01-29T21:20:35.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:2801","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","description":"We have a similar mantra....we only support current browser versions, and that aint IE6.

By using those, we are predominantly sure that our app will not look like a Picasso painting in IE6.

I know I certainly have, and it's a pain to run into the same layout problems over and over again and to address repeatedly the cross browser nuances that inevitably plague us all. I needed a solution or I was going to end up tearing my hair out, driving to Redmond, and bestowing my pent up rage and hatred for Internet Explorer upon some unsuspecting Microsoft peon. Enter Yahoo! to save the day!\n\nYahoo!, in what I can only imagine as a feat of clairvoyance, realized how livid I was regarding this exact subject and came up with the Yahoo User Interface Library CSS Tools, for which I am eternally grateful. There are four main pieces to the CSS tools \u2013 fonts, base, reset, and grids \u2013 each one more awe-inspiring than the last. The basic goal of the entire YUI CSS Tools suite is to normalize your look and feel across all A-grade browsers (as of this writing, Firefox 3 is the only A-grade browser across all operating systems).\n\n<b>Fonts, Reset, and Base</b>\n\nFonts is intended to normalize the font size and line height across all browsers. This means that all your font sizes will be consistent whether or not you look at your page in IE, Safari, or Firefox. Rather than have to add CSS hacks and such nonsense to make it look right in IE, just include this file and all your fonts will look the same with no extra effort on your part.\n\nReset is the core of the three styling tools, and is probably the most useful. It \"removes and neutralizes the inconsistent default styling of HTML elements, creating a level playing field across A-grade browsers and providing a sound foundation upon which you can explicitly declare your intentions.\" The key thing there is \"explicitly declare your intentions.\" This means no unexpected padding or margin issues where IE gives a default margin to an element and another browser does not. Reset takes care of that by making every element look exactly the same in all browsers unless you specify otherwise.\n\nBase, in some ways, is the opposite of reset. \"While Reset removes and neutralizes the inconsistent default styling of HTML elements, Base applies a consistent style foundation for common HTML elements across A-grade browsers. It's certainly optional, but saves you a decent amount of work in having to assign default styles to all the elements. If you want something different than they provide for several, then it's easier to just override those specific tags than have to deal with all of them.\n\n<b>Grids and Grids Builder</b>\n\nLastly, the piece I think is the best thing since Italo Marchioni patented the ice cream cone in 1903. \"Grids offers four preset page widths, six preset templates, and the ability to stack and nest subdivided regions of two, three, or four columns. The 4kb file provides over 1000 page layout combination.\" What does this mean? This means that you no longer need to worry about laying out your CSS divs, containers, leftColumn, and rightColumn nonsense. This takes care of all of that for you. You can even build your layout with their handy grids builder (<a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/builder/\">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/builder/</a>) so there's no guessing or trial-and-error involved.\n\nAdditionally, the result of using Grids has more profound theoretical implications. Being able to keep the structure of the layout (the grid, essentially) separate from the feel of the layout (colors, background-images, etc.) is an often unrealized pipe dream (at least it was for me). But now, that dream has become reality, and how the app feels is separate from how its layout is constructed and all of that is separate from how it behaves. Its helps one obtain a level of abstraction and organization heretofore only achieved by Buddhist monks living in remote Himalayan monasteries.\n\nThanks Yahoo! for helping keep me centered and calm, bringing me that much closer to CSS Nirvana.\n\nFonts - <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/\">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/</a>\nReset - <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/\">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/</a>\nBase - <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/base/\">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/base/</a>\nGrids - <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/\">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/</a>\nGrids Builder - <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/builder/\">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/builder/</a>\n\nSubmitted by Garrison Locke (gplocke)","createdDate":"2009-01-20T18:38:27.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-01-23T01:13:51.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:2623","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","description":"I'll second Garrison's blatant fanboyism.

By language I mean anything different than the default text that we ship with the application, IE the text on the page says \"hello world\" and the application admin wants that to say \"howdy people\" without contacting us.\n\nZend_Translate allows you to do this pretty easy. In your view, you simply can say $this-&gt;translate('hello world') and it will go to your language file and find any entry for \"hello world\" and replace it with whatever is there, in this case \"howdy people\". This is all well and good until you change the default from \"hello world\" to \"whats up world\". Then the translation (which is keyed off of \"hello world\") is broken. So they provide an option, basically defining a key for each place you wanna put text in the app. So instead of $this-&gt;translate(\"Hello World\"), you'd say $this-&gt;translate('default-index-header'). Then you'd provide a default language that maps 'default-index-header' to \"Hello World\", and any new language would map 'default-index-header' to whatever (\"howdy people\") and it would still work, even if you changed the default to \"whats up world\".\n\nThe problem to this solution is that if there is no translation for 'defalul-index-header', it will print \"default-index-header\" to the browser, which means any and all translations have to be complete. Any thoughts on a preferred way to do this?\n\nThis is only really the tip of the iceberg when it comes in i18n, but were working towards a solution. Anyone out there had any experience in designing apps for multiple language support?","createdDate":"2009-01-13T20:51:35.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-01-13T20:51:35.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"Web Programming"},{"id":"2486881:Topic:2305","contributorName":"1x58sgozterf4","title":"Netvibes : Personalized Internet Content Buffet","description":"<p><strong>Netvibes</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.netvibes.com\">www.netvibes.com</a>) is an up-to-the-minute summary of your personal, customizable Web. It's the online tool that lets you scan headlines from 30 or 40 hand-picked websites (or 100 if you're into that kind of thing) in a matter minutes on the very same page you check email, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, del.icio.us, etc. It's an all-you-can-eat, Internet content buffet with no rules on plate sharing.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is this the Best Thing Ever?</strong><br/></p>\n<div style=\"width:280px; float:right; margin-left:10px; margin-bottom:10px; padding:3px; border:1px solid black;\"><p><strong>Name of App / Service</strong><br/> Netvibes</p>\n<p><strong>URL</strong><br/> <a>http://www.netvibes.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>Environment</strong><br/> (online) widget-based ajax desktop</p>\n<p><strong>Operating System</strong><br/> web based</p>\n<p><strong>Intended Audience</strong><br/> Anyone looking for a single site to aggregate a huge variety of content (rss, social networking, web clips, email etc.)</p>\n<p><strong>Screenshot</strong><br/> <a href=\"http://www.webcommdev.com/tim/images/netvibes-screen.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.webcommdev.com/tim/images/netvibes-thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Netvibes Screenshot Thumbnail\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Submitted by</strong><br/> Tim Jones (ukalimbe) and Luis Chacon (lrchacon)</p>\n</div>\nThe essential concept of Netvibes is a personalized website that aggregates virtually any kind of content you want from across the far reaches of the Internet. Although it shares some similarities as a portal, I hesitate to call it one because Netvibes doesn't simply \"lead\" to other sites \u2013 rather, it brings content in. A subtle difference, but a compelling one \u2013 particularly in regards to RSS (more on that later).<p></p>\n<p>What sets Netvibes apart from other online widget-based desktops (iGoogle, myYahoo, Microsft Live, Pageflakes) is, in a word, flexibility. High-quality themes, infinitely-editable color schemes and a huge variety of mix-and-match configurations for one-, two-, three- and four-column layouts make it easy to create a customized grid on which to dump as much stuff as you possibly can. Netvibes allows you to create several pages full of widgetized content, and displays them in a familiar tabbed interface. On top of that, each tab can have a different layout of its own.</p>\n<p>Netvibes offers all of the expected widgets \u2013 weather, email, RSS feeds, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, Google search, along with hundreds of obscure \u2013 but no doubt, useful \u2013 widgets, accessible through a useful search. Search for a widget, click \"Add to my Page\" and there you have it.</p>\n<p>Where Netvibes really shines is with RSS feeds. Adding a feed is as simple as pasting a URL into a text block. Coupled with Netvibes' tabbing and AJAX-ified drag-and-drop, organizing and recording feeds is quick and easy. I have a few RSS tabs, each dedicated to a particular topic, like \"marketing,\" \"technology,\" \"sports,\" \"higher ed\" and \"lolCats,\" making it easy to scan a bunch of content very quickly with some structure. Feeds display cleanly once on the page. Mousing over headlines in a feed displays the first snippet of the content, which is particularly useful for high-speed news scanning. Nothing worse than a pithy headline that, after clicking on it and waiting for the destination site to load, turns out to be a crap story.</p>\n<p>Netvibes also offers a couple options for reading syndicated content as well. You can 1) use the \"feed view\" that \u2013 depending on the particular feed's setup \u2013 will show you a teaser or the full content and the link from Netvibes to the actual content, or 2) the \"show website\" view that sucks in the page containing the content into the Netvibes reader window. And, you can toggle between the two options on the fly. Very handy.</p>\n<p>Social networking sites \u2013 everybody's favorite \u2013 are also easy to integrate into Netvibes. The Facebook widget is very user-friendly, showing your profile summary (inbox, friend requests, invites, status, etc.), a status-update tool and your friends list. Again, clever use of the mouseover, which shows your friends' status updates from the thumbnail view, makes this widget useful for impatient, hurried web browsers like myself. Twitter integration, too, is very well done.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite uses for Netvibes (I do work in public affairs after all) is the monitoring capability provided by pre-populated searches of news, blog, video and photo sites. Every time I log in to Netvibes, I see the most recent results for \"NC State\" or \"NCSU\" on Technorati, YouTube and Flickr, among others.</p>\n<p>Another well-done feature is what I term web clips \u2013 basically iframed web pages. For those sites that do not provide content-syndication options, you can clip an actual page and skim it right in Netvibes. Since Netvibes allows flexibility with different tabs having custom layouts, I set up a web clip on a 2-column page \u2013 the web clip taking 75% of the real estate \u2013 and related RSS feeds in the narrower column. So I have 'dub dub dub' as my main web clip on my NCSU tab and sysnews, ning, and a few other NCSU-specific feeds set up for quick and easy skimming.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of Web 2.0 (are we really still talking about that?), Netvibes gives you the option of setting up a \"public\" page to share your favorite content with the world. Admittedly I haven't taken advantage of this offering, but it's cool to know that it's there if I want to, or others demand that I share my undeniably profound collection of content.</p>","createdDate":"2009-01-13T17:01:19.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-01-14T14:40:44.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:2340","contributorName":"1ou9m4evpyyeo","description":"\"Web 3.0\" is already being used, and anyone that uses it should be immediately regarded with suspicion because they clearly have no idea what they are talking about.\n\nMy favorite early last year were the <a href=\"http://rambleon.org/2008/03/18/just-fyi/\">fools using \"Web 1.5\"</a>","createdDate":"2009-01-14T14:40:44.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:2307","contributorName":"3p7bzgj31hmap","description":"I'm tired of \"Web 2.0\" as a phrase too, and the first person who says \"Web 3.0\" gets punched or at least ridiculed. ;)\n\nYeah, I use iGoogle and have used Netvibes in the past, but I've gotten in the habit of using Google Reader for everything.

In some ways, it makes our deployment of web applications a lot easier, because we have a singular code base for shared libraries and don't have to worry about duplicating those all over the place. That is both a convenience and a liability at the same time.

I do a lot of stuff from traditional ISP's that require you to FTP things and most IDE's work fine with that, so you can't really tell that the files are on a remote system.

Mostly types of things that exec out system calls and such. For Apache we AllowOverride AuthConfig FileInfo Limit and Options MultiViews. We specifically don't allow FollowSymLinks. Since this is all stored in AFS, with symlinks it's very easy to link a non web locker into a web locker and inadvertently make the locker served out to the world. This had been a problem in the past so we disallow it now. As a side note, even with this disabled, Apache itself can follow symlinks, it just won't serve out files that are symlinked. This narrow case lead our ECE department to develop and application called GuardDog for central management of .htaccess files. The .htaccess files are generated, stored in a single location, and then you can symlink to them in the directories they are needed.\n\nWe refer to subsites as site lockers. Each site locker has 3 pts groups that belong to it, an admin group, write group, and read group. The read group is obvious, the write and admin groups both have full write access but the admin group is used to also control membership of the other groups. Individual logins are all afs ids. Group membership is managed through a web app that puts the information in a database and a perl cron job picks up the changes every 10 minutes. If additional pts groups are needed, they can be created as being owned by the admin group and the tools will pick up these groups and allow them to be managed through the same portal. That's a feature that isn't really used much for the web lockers.\n\nSite lockers can also have a mysql database associated with them by request. Each database has 3 logins, a read id which only has select, a write id that has select, update, delete, and insert, and an admin id which can create, alter, and drop tables etc. We haven't really let anyone do things with views or stored procedures so far but only people in our own group have asked about them.\n\nSite lockers are requested on a web page, we then approve them and run a perl script that handles the creation of the volume, pts groups, database and database ids. It also mounts the volume. Site lockers are triple mounted in various paths to facilitate file based access for both the servers and the users.\n\nIt looks like <a href=\"http://www.engr.ncsu.edu\">www.engr.ncsu.edu</a> currently has 77 site lockers. That may be partially inflated due to the fact that if you want a separate database, then you need a separate site locker. While <a href=\"http://www.engr.ncsu.edu\">www.engr.ncsu.edu</a> is probably our biggest shared vhost like this, all of our 70ish vhosts have these capabilities.

(which is when the genesis of this locker model thing began). Actually we don't have to rewind really because the situation hasn't changed much for the target audience, but it's good to realize that we are talking about the state of PHP and Web applications 7 years ago.\n\nEngineering had all these podunk exceptions around on the engineering webservers, unused or half-used perl-based forms, server side includes - where somebody *had* to have something - and because they *had* to have something, they put pressure on my predecessors to \"make it work\" and my predecessors either thought that was fine (or didn't have much choice) - and the exception was long forgotten - and every so often, some script kiddie would come along and use the form to spam the hell out of somebody. Or we'd change something and it'd break, and something that somebody used once a year wouldn't work and we'd get screamed at.\n\nOh, and let's not think about all the web accessible directories that had student files in them with social security numbers.\n\nSo knowing we needed to have something that we knew worked, and having needs for PHP ourselves, we wanted to replace all that scripted crap with a scripting model that could be available everywhere.\n\nBut available everywhere has a price - because what we had (have) is a whole bunch of faculty/graduate students/staff that get the brilliant idea to download \"some code\" off the net, and run it on a webserver without the foggiest idea what that code does, how it works, and the I/O points in it. It's treated like some application you download for the desktop. Only it's not your desktop anymore where you only screw yourself up when you install Bob's Great Application - it's a shared web server.\n\nSo, not only did open_basedir provide a block for a PHP applications from reading ../../../somebodyelse'swebaccessibledirectory (which honestly - while a concern, the real odds of somebody doing that are pretty low - we weren't providing smart, bored, students access, it was smart, but clueless-about-web-programming and too busy faculty, their grad students, and overworked staff) - it also threw up a roadblock for Bob to download PHP-app-that-he-knows-nothing-about and install it without understanding it. If Bob had to take some time and fix the application so that it would be self contained - well he'd become a little more edumacated about the application that he was taken on responsibility for. At least for that semester until their TA funds ran out.\n\nThat was the theory anyway. It probably turned out to mainly just annoy the heck out of those groups that were taking responsibility for their applications, like ITECS itself, ECE, etc. But some of those applications that needed to be run (like the drupals and the wordpresses, and the mediawikis) should have been pulled out of AFS web environments and put on their own servers. At the time though, that was a struggle because exception handling is hard to manage. And there's the \"eat your own dog food\" principle. And VMWare still wasn't viable even 4 years ago.\n\nTo this day, I remain a little surprised about how many off-the-shelf apps an open_basedir restriction broke. In the framework world, it's a little different. But this was PHP pre-viable frameworks.\n\n6-7 years later, the world has changed more than a bit.

The early part of the proposal seems to allude to multiple solutions for different situations which I firmly agree with. I think many times single solution leads to a lot of compromise and least common denominator solutions that don't meet anyone's needs. The Engineering web infrastructure has these issues too. The open_basedir=./ restriction is needed for large shared vhosts such as <a href=\"http://www.engr.ncsu.edu\">www.engr.ncsu.edu</a> however smaller single owner vhosts could get by with something different. It adds to the support, maintenance, and configuration complexity though. I think that largely the idea of groups running their own webservers as a point of pride or because it's cool has past. Now I think people do it because what is currently offered for some reason isn't palatable to them due to features, restrictions, cost, etc.\n\nI think there should probably be a couple of more focused solutions for campus. Something like the single click deployable webapps that are regularly patched and updated would be great for a number of students, faculty, and even groups and centers. Other groups would need spaces that they could develop themselves that included things like databases, commonly used frameworks (that are patched), and separate development/testing and live areas. Some of these options could be outsourced/resold while the others maintained in house.\n\nAs for AFS, I certainly agree that it doesn't work for all situations. As Charles mentioned, ISOs and other large files are limited. Total site size (beyond 2 GB) isn't necessarily an issue as it can be solved with multiple volumes but sometimes on media heavy sites this can get unwieldy. I've seen that mostly with gallery installs. The issue with AFS server failures while real (as shown last night) but even after everything I went through last night, I don't consider show stoppers and could be designed around. If you're talking about a push to publish or push from dev to live style solution, that could easily incorporate read only servers and the push handling the volume releases. Plus, quite frankly, we haven't had a huge number of afs server issues. Half of our AFS servers have been running since they were patched for the time zone change 2 years ago. I think there's another discussion about storage and file systems so I'll just save further comments for there. I know I'm probably coming off sounding like an AFS fan boy but I'm not. I fully believe we should move away from AFS for certain solutions and data storage needs. I just don't think AFS should be automatically discounted.","createdDate":"2009-01-14T00:57:31.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:2303","contributorName":"1g0vgtzqw7h6n","description":"I think making it available to everyone, yet not forcing it is a good plan.\n\nWith respect to the www4 service, what I would like to see is the ability to replace that with something like Google Sites (or a similar solution).

We often teach them how to use Adobe Contribute, but that's not always a great solution either because of licensing requirements and sometimes the functionality of the product (particularly for folks who use a wireless connection).

In that setup, it's not something that's attempting to scale to unused levels -- it's merely the case that whoever wants it can pay for it, and if only two individuals want it, the university as a whole hasn't put resources in to something designed for 1,000 users. To me, that's more of a true cost recovery.\n\nI think that too often many of the \"charged\" for services don't represent actual cost recovery, and in that case, many (most?) of the pricing structures quickly become inconsistent with what one could find outside the organization. This leads to less cohesiveness in the federated IT structure that exists within NCSU because folks go out and develop their own solutions or implementations at a cheaper cost than buying in to the OIT-provided model.

These include acquiring the software licenses for an on-campus solution, acquiring a 3rd party solution (or multiple ones), and receiving support for all things involved.\n\nItem 2: It is my hope that the service will just be part of what we offer, with no additional cost to the user/college/organization. If you are NCSU, you get it. This is my hope no matter what our solution is, internal or out-sourced. Of course this totally depends on the cost to OIT, and also if we still do have the funding that you are talking about from the University. If we did take on a pay-for-service model, I would guarantee that it will be more inline with what ISP's are offering as opposed to our current $300/year (or whatever it is) cost for MySQL DB only.\n\nItem 3: This is an interesting question. The fact is that not everyone on campus is interested in a service like this. And yes, scaling to a magnitude of a possible 60,000 users could hinder our ability to be agile with the process. However, I believe this should be a service that is available to anyone on campus regardless of your primary role at the University. I think it is totally possible for us to design a system that could handle 60,000 accounts IF it needed to, without sacrificing the goals of the project. Does that mean we are going to create a system for 60K accounts up front? Probably not. But if we design it saying \"only <i>x</i> amount of people will want to use this\", when <i>x</i> + 1 people want the service, we have painted ourselves into a corner.\n\nWe are having another meeting today to start on our project plan, which will more clearly lay out some goals and strategies for moving forward.

If it is an in-house solution, I would strongly urge against that because, regardless of the price, you minimize the ultimate impact and continue the likelihood that other units/colleges will simply continue to do their own thing. The whole cost recovery model process (which is a complete misnomer in most instances that it's used) is something that needs to be revisited and reconsidered within OIT as I see it -- I believe the university provides resources to the organization to provide services for it.

When any single AFS file server goes south, the volumes on that server timeout... on the order of 5 minutes per request. That stalls out the one child process in apache, waiting 5 minutes for a reply. As more requests come in, more children get stall out. eventually you hit the 250 child limit, and the entire web server (80 hosts) is no longer functions... from a single point of failure on an AFS file server.\n\nSecond, there's no compelling reason to have web files available everywhere. They need to be available on the web server. Not on any and every campus client in the world. In some ways, this has proven to be a security problem (remember what happens when someone embeds a password in a script that is world readable in AFS).\n\nThirdly, AFS does not handle standard user/group permissions models. In many ways, the PTS system is superior. In this, it is not. Commercial web hosting assigns a userid and expects the file system to obey the files by the userid. AFS can only control access by server IP. Or, you have to find some convoluted way to get tickets/tokens for the user, and make sure those only apply to the right connection and not to the other connections concurrently on the machine. It is far, far easier to throw away the AFS model and use Unix perms that work, than to fix AFS/PTS to work the wat that we need it to.\n\n2GB volume limit... Is still an artificial limit that we impose operationally. It started with that being the limit on the size we could comfortably backup. Now that number is closer to 4GB I think, or even unlimited. Keep in mind that no matter what size, the volume is locked out when a backup is in progress; the larger the volume, the longer the lockout. The other hard limit I know of is a single file cannot be larger than 4GB on our AFS. (may be fixed in a version newer than what we run). This means no ISO-dumps of DVDs. In practice, many of our file servers are still running AFS 1.2 which has a lovely bug in caching whenever the size of a single file exceeds maxint (2.1GB).","createdDate":"2009-01-12T20:51:11.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:2247","contributorName":"0cddqfx9u95kt","description":"*grin* Fair enough!

I have to say, this is one of the most heavily-used apps on my phone.","createdDate":"2009-01-06T15:23:41.000Z"}]},{"id":"2486881:Topic:1985","contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","title":"Digsby: The Only Social Networking Client You'll Need","description":"<b>Name of App / Service</b>\nDigsby\n\n<b>URL</b>\n<a href=\"http://www.digsby.com\">http://www.digsby.com</a>\n\n<b>Environment</b>\nDesktop\n\n<b>Operating System</b>\nWindows\nLinux and Mac versions are in planning: <a href=\"http://www.digsby.com/signup/maclinux\">http://www.digsby.com/signup/maclinux</a>\n\n<b>Intended Audience</b>\n\n* Social Networking Addicts\n* Email'ers\n* Twitter'ers\n* Facebook'ers\n* LinkedInn'ers\n* Instant Messenger'ers\n\n\n<b>Screenshot</b>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class=\"noborder\" href=\"discussions/134-ScreenHunter_01Jan.0607.35.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"discussions/135-ScreenHunter_01Jan.0607.35.jpg?width=66\" alt=\"\" width=\"66\" height=\"150\"/></a></p>\n\n<b>Submitted by</b>\nNick Young (usaussie)\n\n\n<b>Why is this an App of the Week?</b>\n\nIn simple terms, Digsby is a desktop-application-un-clutterer, for people who participate in several chat, email, and social networking circles.\n\nFor example, before Digsby came along, my system tray was home to the following apps, either all at the same time, or in different combinations:\n\n* AOL Instant Messenger\n* Yahoo Messenger\n* MSN Messenger\n* Google Chat\n* Gmail Notifier\n* Twhirl (for Twitter)\n* Pidgin (for Jabber and other IM stuff)\n\n\n...and i would also have a browser open to inform me of any new postings to Facebook, LinkedIn, and my Gmail account. Yes, i did consolidate some of the IM stuff into Pidgin, but that wasn't overnight either.\n\nNow my system tray holds the following apps:\n\n* Digsby\n\nThat's awesome.\n\nWhen you fire up Digsby, you add your different accounts and passwords, and then sit back and watch the notifications roll in.\n\nThis is all configurable, with themes, options for what to show and what not to show, so this is just how i have it set up. It looks like a regular buddy list window, just with different sections for the different accounts.\n\nIn the main window area, it lists all the chat buddies from all of your accounts. It aggregates them into a single list, so you don't have to worry about which protocol/service the buddy is on.\n\nAt the base of the list, it shows the 3 (currently) supported social networking services (Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn). You can write to each service directly from the Digsby panel too, so you don't have to open a browser to do anything. You can connect and manage as many twitter accounts, Facebook accounts or whatever you want. This makes it easy to send tweets out for both a personal and professional account, without having to open a browser, or run multiple applications.\n\nBeneath that, it shows any email accounts you have configured to connect to. Currently, it supports:\n\n* Gmail\n* Yahoo Mail\n* Hotmail\n* Any IMAP Account\n* Any POP account\n* AOL/IM Mail\n\n\nIMO, the good thing about Digsby is the notifications. The notifications can come as a sound, a popup, a prompt, a nice web 2.0'ish gradient box that fades in and out somewhere on your screen...its all pretty flexible. Turn on the options you want, and turn off the others. I like the fading notifications in a certain area of my dual monitor setup, so they don't get in the way, but so I still notice them.\n\nThe only drawback I've found in the last 3 weeks of using Digsby, is that it does not support AOL chat rooms.\n\nThe last neat feature of Digsby, is that the settings are kept out there in the cloud. So I don't need to worry about keeping several configurations and settings up to date on my office desktop PC, laptop, and home pc. I just sign up for Digsby, install it wherever I want, and all my settings are loaded exactly the same at each location. Even if you forget to close it at home, and then open it at work, it still plays nice. You just get some nice little messages from your ol' AOL System buddy, telling you that your account has been signed into at multiple locations.\n\nBottom line...the concept of Digsby rocks....and the actual application does too.","createdDate":"2009-01-06T12:38:10.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-01-06T12:38:10.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"The Best Thing Ever!"},{"id":"2486881:Topic:1944","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","title":"Questions for Dr. Marc Hoit","description":"Our first interviewee is Dr. Marc Hoit, the not-so-new-anymore CIO here at NCSU.

I think that there is some value in having a service like www4, but I think that overall, we could do a better job of providing this type of service to folks. I think there are essentially two categories of folks who need a service enabling them to create their own web pages:\n\n- users who want something basic where having the ability to set something up easily (in a Google Sites type of way) is a tremendous advantage over what we have because it gives them the ability to throw something together very quickly. There are many faculty (and quite likely many students) who need/want to throw up some basic information without having to know anything about web development -- and \"just use DreamWeaver or Contribute\" aren't acceptable solutions.\n\n- users who want or need to have the ability to develop their own websites in the traditional sense, have the ability to create data-driven components, or write other applications (essentially having access to a PHP and MySQL environment).\n\nI would guess this second group of users would be a smaller percentage of users than the first group, and given that, I think that the service provided for them wouldn't necessarily need to be \"scaled\" so that the entire campus could use it -- in fact, it may be better if it's not scaled to that degree since that often seems to create limitations which could make the end-result less useful than was originally intended.\n\nWe have a couple of classes within the technical writing discipline within CHASS that focuses on teaching students how to create dynamic, data-driven websites using PHP/MySQL. Typically we run a separate server for these classes to provide them access to the tools that they need to do their course work. I'm sure there are other courses in other disciplines in other colleges which have similar needs requiring their college units to provide similar access. It seems as though it would be far more efficient if there was a centrally provided service that could meet these various needs, while also giving access to the self-motivated computer science/computer engineering/etc. student who would like to experiment with and learn about this type of software development.\n\nIn addition, I thought I would expand upon the definition of exorbitant as it relates to NelNet. Recently, CHASS looked in to the possibility of switching our college giving site over to having a NelNet back-end. The cost we received from OIT to provide this was $4,000. However, if we wanted to do some of the work ourselves, the cost WENT UP to $7,000. Given Daniel's previous experiences with NelNet and my own experiences with assisting in the development of donation sites using credit cards, these labor costs seem extremely high. There are multiple groups within my college (and likely within units across campus) that sell items online (books, DVDs, other merchandise) and would love to have an easy way to tie in to a centrally managed (and consistent) back-end to accept credit card purchases. But when you consider a ~$50 a month charge for having a NelNet account, plus the up-front development costs, they would have to generate a massive amount of business in order to simply break even. I'm not sure if this issue is in the scope of what was originally intended, but I think e-commerce is certainly something that is within this vein.\n\nFinally, I would encourage the folks that are organizing the interview to send the link to this page over to Marc so that he can possibly reply directly himself to questions, ask follow-ups, etc. as I think that would be a more engaging and fruitful interview method.","createdDate":"2009-01-08T15:23:33.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:2115","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","description":"I get the gist of what you are asking.

We had really good intentions to unit test all the apps that we write, but actually we don't do much (if any) of that. We met Sebastian Bergman, author of PHPUnit, at ZendCon and he has developed a nice way to run unit tests on PHP apps. There is even a Zend_Test suite. They have made it easy, but we just can't seem to carve the time to write unit tests as effectively as we'd like.\n\nWe have been known to use the \"F5 Methodology of Testing\", also know as the \"Ctrl-R Testing Suite\" :)....but that really isn't a good way of testing.\n\nOur development cycle forces us into allowing the end user to test, but I'd rather our end user not be our test subject if possible. We've looked at using <a href=\"http://seleniumhq.org/\">Selenium</a> but have never really gone past looking. Anyone out there used that ever? Good, bad, indifferent?\n\nI guess that leads me to my real question, how are you guys out there testing your applications?","createdDate":"2008-12-10T21:20:54.000Z","updatedDate":"2011-01-26T17:39:33.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"Web Programming","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:2107","contributorName":"1ou9m4evpyyeo","description":"Like everyone else I'm sure we don't do anywhere near enough of the usability and user testing that we probably should do. Thankfully we have a really good UI and design person out of those four that when we let him near a given product, the usability improves - but we still have some apps (or some functions in some of the apps) that are a complete mess (not Ben's fault at all - it's mainly the apps that we care about less) I'm not completely sure about his testing methodology, I know it's a lot of cross-browser testing and starting with a foundation of semantic markup - we usually don't have a lot of actual UI bugs - unless it involves things like standard javascript and css and [expletives removed] Internet Explorer version 6.\n\nOn the functional side, our development model helps mitigate a lot of formal QA and testing. Every developer has a full-stack development environment locally, that comes pretty close to what's running in production. Some of us will continually download a copy of the production db for that application and use it in local development to make sure that we are developing against real data.\n\nIn theory - and sometimes practice - we are continually deploying to a [site].demo.extension.org vhost - which has the same configuration as production, and a close-to-current copy of the production data on it for more \"open\" testing.\n\nAnd also, In theory, those interested (or that have complained before) in production releases for that application are invited to demo the application (depending on which of the applications it is) - and are invited to put the demo app through their usage paces - which in practice they <b>never</b> do. So we try to release often to production to watch it get real world use.\n\nOne thing that's nice about our development and deployment environment is that exceptions triggered in the application will generate emails to a mailing list for us. On more than one occasion, I've had some code path I forgot about - and it was executed with somebody doing something I didn't test for, it would generate an exception, which I'd see, and often, I'd have the problem fixed and redeployed before the person that had the error would get around to notifying us there was a problem.\n\nAdditionally, our whole team gets checkin notifications for all the applications we develop (using a subversion post-commit hook to send email, but our source is also open, so there are open feeds too). That gives us a chance to do at least ad-hoc code reviews. We don't have anything formally, or even habitually in place, in doing that, but we can see if something really out of the ordinary is coming as a group. Being open with everything also goes a long way to helping with the QA.\n\nAs far as unit testing, three of us have been doing some kind of development - web development at that - for 10+ years. None of us have come up in the age of \"unit testing\" and so we got used to not doing it - and while we want to believe in it - every - and I mean every (okay, we had one that didn't) contractor we've had that had the unit testing religion has turned in miserable results when it came to real world use. It's like somehow \"it passed all the test\" came along and substituted for a modicum of \"did you actually try anything an application user would do?\" So that's cast a bit of a dim view on the utility of unit testing. I imagine if we were writing more \"API-oriented\" applications - where other developers were implementing services that depended on queries and results we'd change our minds\n\nSo basically, our testing strategy boils down to: 1) make sure we develop against real data, 2) cross-browser walkthroughs, 3) as-close-to-standards, clean, semantic, output that we can get 4) exception notifications, 5) event logging, 6) release early and often and 7) using experience (or wild-arse guessing) to differentiate between real problems and um, er, \"training opportunities\"","createdDate":"2009-01-07T15:51:07.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:1623","contributorName":"2k7vvpf9lb3q6","description":"One of my favorite tests is the <b><a href=\"http://www.uie.com/articles/five_second_test/\">5 second usability test</a></b>, yes it's really only 5 seconds.\n\n<i>Most content pages have a distinct primary purpose. In the case of RedCross.org's Donation content page, the primary purpose was to communicate to users all of their contribution options. This is a high-risk page for the Red Cross. If it fails, they risked losing hundreds of thousands of dollars of essential contributions.\n\nAs we often do in other types of usability tests, we start by giving users a focused task. For the Donation page, we gave users a simple task:\n\n\"You're ready to donate to the Red Cross organization. But you're unsure of what kind of donation to make. What are your donation options?\"\n\nNext, before we show the user our page, we tell them we'll only display it for 5 seconds. We ask them to try to remember everything they see in this short period.\n\nOnce the user views the entire page for 5 seconds, we remove it by either covering it up or switching to another window. Then, we ask them to write down everything they remember about the page. When they finish jotting down their recollections, we ask two useful questions to assess whether users accomplished the task. For the Donations page, we'd ask, \"What is the most important information on this page?\" and \"How would you go about donating to the Red Cross?\"</i>\n\nIts interesting to hear what users remember about your page and what they thought the primary purpose of the page was with only 5 seconds to review it. Often times, the message or goal you were trying to communicate to the user was not as clear as you thought it was.\n\nSo why just 5 seconds? Several studies have found that a user will make a decision about the relevance of your page in less than 5 seconds, and if they didn't feel it was relevant (trustworthy, engaging, etc), they'll leave. We have all done it before,... paging aimless through Google search results... how many times have you clicked a search result link, gone to the page and then said \"This isnt what I want, [back button!]\". Sometimes I find myself moving fast enough to rule out 8 to 10 pages in less than a minute, so those first five seconds are very important.\n\nI'd be more than willing to regularly test and give feedback to any of your pages, applications on campus.

It's the Form builder module: an AJAX, Drag and Drop interface for constructing forms in Drupal. We hope that it will become the defacto standard in building forms in Drupal, replacing our inconsistent form-building tools that are spread across CCK, Webform, Profile, and other modules.\n\n\n\nDrag and drop and AJAXy, but degrades too! No need for JavaScript required.\n\n\nOverview\nThe Form builder project reads and modifies Forms API arrays. Using a well-known data-structure that most Drupal developers are familiar with should make for low barrier to entry for utilizing the new module.\n\nThe project uses a AJAX-based interface for updating form elements. As you modify properties such as \"Title\" or \"Description\", Form builder makes requests in the background to update the element through Drupal's internal FAPI system. The user gets a live preview of their changes without saving the form. This approach means that no additional JavaScript needs to be written by implementing modules, since the rendering is done in PHP and then sent to the client as needed.\n\nDemo\nEnough talk, go try out the demo and see it in action.\n\nImplementing Form Builder\n\n\nRead it here:\n<a href=\"http://www.lullabot.com/blog/drupals-form-building-future\">http://www.lullabot.com/blog/drupals-form-building-future</a>","createdDate":"2008-12-04T14:30:22.000Z","updatedDate":"2008-12-04T14:30:22.000Z","approved":"Y","groupId":"2486881:Group:225"},{"id":"2486881:Topic:824","contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","title":"Twitter Status Design Tutorials, Icons and WP Plugins","description":"I know there's a growing community of NCSU Twitterers, so here's a link to some resources about how to extend your twittering past the defaults...enjoy:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.noupe.com/tutorial/20-twitter-status-design-tutorials-icons-wp-plugins.html\">http://www.noupe.com/tutorial/20-twitter-status-design-tutorials-icons-wp-plugins.html</a>","createdDate":"2008-11-21T02:56:40.000Z","updatedDate":"2008-11-21T04:25:18.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"Web Programming","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:834","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","description":"FYI, Zend Framework has accepted a proposal for a Zend_Service_Twitter to be put in the incubator immediately.

Assuming the community is led by people who understand the needs and wants of their community and the world at large, you can move forward - making amendments as needed a la the U.S. Constitution. Also, should the leaders choose a different path which defies their user base, a coup (fork) is quite simple as they can't take away the code which was developed under the Open Source license. By having an active community, it is best not to modify the core code so that the upgrade path is a simple one. Plugins and a modular infrastructure make customizations simple and portable. The dedication to standards compliance is usually related to the desire for a high quality example of an application using Open Source practices.\n\nThe experience I do have with Sakai isn't Sakai specific, but comes down to its implementation. Sakai vs. Moodle is to me the battle between Java and PHP. The LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) is a top to bottom Open Source environment. Java on the other hand has a long history of proprietary software implementation. Although it has made large strides recently, my experience with the setup, maintenance, development, and implementation of Java-based web applications is wrought with the patented \"frowny face\". Java is the 300 pound gorilla of resource usage.

The OIT Drupal install assumes that our users want to use tinyMCE as the editor of choice, and let that application reformat HTML as it sees fit. The Drupal site itself is told that all node content is Full HTML, that is, Drupal applies no further filtering.\nThe problem is users like Don and probably others, who know their way around HTML and need to use special features that the tinyMCE editor is too stupid to recognize.\nThe example that he gave me is this: he wants to write a form, and it needs to include fieldsets. TinyMCE is right out... it doesn't have any way (as configured at least) to help him write forms. The work around with most complex HTML is use the raw HTML mode of tinyMCE, paste in the code from another HTML page editor, and then save the data to drupal. The problem is, tinyMCE destroys the fieldsets. Apparently it's built-in HTML cleanup code does not handle the tags correctly. So even though he has told tinyMCE to take the code as he wrote it, it still applies a cleanup filter before saving the data to drupal\nHas anyone else run into this sort of problem before? Is there an easy way to configure drupal to bypass tinyMCE and accept raw HTML? On a per-user or per-document basis would be better still.","createdDate":"2008-11-11T19:33:09.000Z","updatedDate":"2010-01-31T22:36:54.000Z","approved":"Y","category":"Applications","comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:10628","contributorName":"e12vds0aqfkv","description":"Another option to webforms or forms api, is to create a custom content type with cck.\n\nFor tinymce settings (/admin/settings/tinymce), you can specify whether users have the option to use tinymce by default.

This discussion was prompted as a result of the migration of the OIT website to Drupal and questions that came about as a result of that project. Questions like:\nHow do we deliver applications (like Drupal) to more than just a few folks?\nHow do we keep common applications secure and updated?\nHow do we manage support and training as the number of users grows?\nHow do we provide solutions when the \u201cflavor of the wee\u201d application is no longer wanted?\n\n<b>The \u201cState of Web Services\u201d address</b>\nCurrent web service delivery is: (1) AFS-based, managed by a central database server, (2) provides access to PHP and Perl, (3) is available via request, and (4) training and support for end users exists for it.\nThere are some issues with this model: (1) web server security issues via AFS, (2) limited to PHP and Perl (no Ruby, Python, ColdFusion), (3) technology upgrade issues (PHP4 to PHP5 transition), (4) limited access (costs, University affiliation, www4), (5) limited support for common applications, and (6) no centralized delivery for common applications.\n\n<b>What are our needs?</b>\nNeeds from a service-provider perspective include: (1) a scalable, secure solution for delivering web services, (2) an agile environment adaptable to changing needs, (3) the ability to deliver and update common applications, (4) a supportable infrastructure, and (5) an efficient strategy for deployment.\nNeeds from a consumer perspective include: (1) to be able to easily request and get access to the tools needed, (2) fast turn-around time, (3) lots of options for applications and technologies, (4) ongoing updates and maintenance, (5) uptime and backups, and (6) support and training staff to help along the way.\n\nIndustrial Engineering: We have a lot of issues with configuration options.\n\nBarry (from OIT): (1) Effective ways to manage permissions with whatever web applications we have, both individual access and group access. (2) It would be helpful to have a wrap-protected demo to just try out a product.\n\nGlen Waters of the Vet School: Sometimes commercial apps need to be supported, too. (e.g, Oracle, ColdFusion, etc.). They bought a hospital application that\u2019s supposed to work with Oracle, but when that didn\u2019t work easily, they needed support. Noted that commercial applications should be considered as well when interfacing with existing campus resources.\n\nAlan Gerber (from CNR) I\u2019d like to see an expanded effort in terms of collaboration. There is no community or forum where I can say, \u201cHey this is out there if you want to use it.\u201d\n\nAlan Shuler (with CALS): We have a diverse campus with different computing needs, but we tend to operate like it isn\u2019t. That is we tend to try and have a central way of doing things and that\u2019s what we focus on supporting. \u201cIf it\u2019s not the model, we can\u2019t do it\u201d approach can\u2019t work. We need to top-down model going from the outside-in model to the inside-out model.\n\n<b>A possible solution?</b>\nWe\u2019re interested in your thoughts on a few things:\nIs there even a need to change from the current model?\nWhat kind of solutions would work for your needs?\nAre we missing something that is important to you?\n\nJeff? from ?: I see the value of having a separate instance that I can control and modify. I\u2019ve been looking at things like what Google is offering. Like here\u2019s the version you can pick from. We run it. You can add stuff in. I don\u2019t know that I necessarily want to be stuck in \u201chere\u2019s the level we\u2019re going to stick to, support, and have\u2026\u201d\n\nJosh Gira (CNR): Looking at our college with a lot of extension services. We need a method to make things available to off-campus groups in the extensions. People come to them and say we want to do this, but that isn\u2019t available on campus.\n\nGlen Waters of the Vet School: An outside group would like to get into our services, like Vets that want to use our data. We would love to be able to let a vet look at the information for all of the patients they have referred, for example. The most useful thing I\u2019ve gotten from you guys was that listserv where everyone\u2019 introducing themselves.\n\nAnother person (didn\u2019t introduce): A way to know what\u2019s going on on campus in general would be good.\n\nDan: For Drupal. We already have modules. They exist. It would be good to know what they are, so people don\u2019t have to create themselves.\n\nJason: We\u2019ve thrown around the idea of going toward the \u201chosting model.\u201d One-click installs to be able to publish these centralized applications out. Someone asked if this would include students. Yes.\n\nJohn Martin (OCC): Mentioned the notion of a culture change to self-help first then there be an expert at the help desk.\n\nCharlie Morris from CNR: W/Drupal if there were a page with every drupal instance, who the owner is and maybe a summary page of what they\u2019re doing with Drupal. If OIT could create communities of users. Jason mentioned the challenge of keeping them updated. Someone mentioned making it a Wiki where we people can keep the list updated themselves.\n\nSomeone asked if OIT has asked how UNC and Duke are doing this. They are next to talk to. There might be some opportunity for that at UNC Cause.\n\nTed Gyro (Univ Housing and Greek Life): Just joined the listserv (webdevelopers). The school I came from, OIT was very centralized. 7 or 8 web developers did all of the web work for 30,000 students. I strongly support the notion of building community to help each other. I\u2019d rather go through that than through the help desk.\n\nLaura Thompson form EAS: Seconds the notion of communities. Social networking seems to be a recurring answer. Maybe we have a place with profiles (techies.ncsu.edu exists but is not currently heavily used).\n\nRay Kinsey (?) CALS Extension: Would like to second a couple of things: We need faster turnaround on versions (of some product they\u2019re using that I missed). We\u2019ve been on V5 for too long. MySQL would cost us a fortune if we had to pay for every single db. I think looking at the way you charge for db\u2019s needs to be looked at. The forums/social networking\u2026 I know more about what\u2019s going on in my particular role at other universities because I follow people at those universities who are doing what i\u2019m doing.\n\nLaura: One easy way to make sure people know about lists is to have HR include majordomo info in orientation. A monthly summary of things that are going out already from \u201ctop dogs\u201d to include a blurb in there.\n\nShawn Dunning from Textiles: I like the idea of talking about this. One thing that would be advantageous to doing it in-house . When you go to sign up for a hosting plan, here is a list of the things you should know\u2026 or include it in the package when someone signs up that it tells them where there are listservs related to that product/service.\n\nSomeone noted that the number of people actually controlling resources on this campus is pretty small. (Academic IT directors, which we established several years ago tells OIT\u2026) What we haven\u2019t seen is the same kind of initiative of OIT coming back to us. Proactively go out to the colleges and say, \u201cWho has an interest in this and would like to come help us with it?\u201d The help desk issue: he has two tickets about things he thinks are important, but he has no idea what their statuses are. As a \u201ccollege director(?)\u201d I would expect to not have to root around in Remedy to find out what\u2019s happening with my problems.\n\nBarry: Wanted to make a plug Wiki service that would have access controls. Let\u2019s say you have a project, and you need certain pages to be internal. We want to make some pages protected. I would suggest OIT look at something called \u201cCompliments\u201d (?). [Someone else seconded this.]\n\nJason: With services that you guys want that we can\u2019t provide support for: For you, would it be better for us to have a service that we can\u2019t support, or do you expect support if we do offer it.\n\nJohn (Advanced Analytics): Some kind of in-house knowledge repository, best practices, etc. would have helped us tremendously in coming onboard with who AFS lockers, etc. work. He agreed that they want to be programmers, not sys admins.\n\nPeople seemed to agree that if OIT said they would make sure you have a license and that it\u2019s up and running. OIT doesn\u2019t have to know all of the technologies. Some of the things that are campus-wide should probably have support.\n\nJason noted that training is an area where folks could help OIT out. If you\u2019re going to teach a class of 10 people in your area, considering opening it up to everyone to teach anyone who might be interested.\n\nNo name/dept: Here it is. Use at your own risk. As long as that\u2019s clear up front, that would be okay.\nFollowup on community aspect: Would like to see OIT provide a PHP/CPC list that people could share and maybe be associated with a repository. WRT looking at the teaching: Open up our classmate model where we always look internally for a class teacher, look outside into the community/campus to offer the classes.\n\nLaura: Wouldn\u2019t mind services if they weren\u2019t supported as there are often other ways to learn. The only concern I would have would be about how often do you update. For instance, I wouldn\u2019t want to get something from you that was at level x of Perl when I can only use it if it\u2019s at y level.\n\nAnother person from the Vet school: He\u2019s worried about things going away that they\u2019re using, for instance, streaming media services.\n\nAndy Raynor from the College of Education: would love to see Joomla available to manage web sites.\n\nA community site with links to these things that people have tried or are already using would be helpful.\n\nOld school: I prefer pull to push. Jason talked about personal preferences.\n\nSomeone mentioned providing a place to give feedback after this meeting.
