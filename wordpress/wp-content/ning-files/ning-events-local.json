The areas covered this year are Mobile, CSS3, HTML5, Javascript, ColdFusion and General Development.<br/> <br/> <strong>Speakers</strong><br/> Marquee Speakers include Adam Lehman, Elisha Dvorak, Hemant Khandelwal and Raymond Camden, from Adobe Systems along with Jonathan LeBlanc and Pragati Rai from Paypal. Many other distinguished speakers from around the country round out the roster for NCDevCon 2012.<br/> For the $200 registration fee, NCDevCon delivers quite a bit of value. 44 different sessions run in 4 track categories. Attendees have their choice of 4 different sessions for each of the 11 time slots so there is always something interesting going on. At no extra cost, attendees receive lunch at the conference location on both Saturday and Sunday. Unlimited snacks, soda, juice and refreshments will be provided throughout the conference. Plus, attendees get access to the Saturday Night After-party held on the conference site with free food, beverages and opportunities to network with their fellow conference attendees.</p>\n<p><br/> <strong>Hands On Classes</strong><br/> NCDevCon also includes several instructor led hands-on classes at no additional charge for attendees. The hands-on classes are conducted in a Bring Your Own Laptop format. Since an instructor leads the class participants through practical application of a technology, this represents a great training opportunity for developers to learn new technology fast.<br/> The current hands-on class list is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction to Mobile Applications with PhoneGap/Cordova</li>\n<li>Building Applications With HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript</li>\n<li>GIT: Choosing Workflows That Make Sense</li>\n<li>JQuery Mobile 101</li>\n<li>Authentication Using Twitter, Google, Facebook, And More</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/> The 4th NCDevCon is shaping up to be the can't-miss developer training and conference event in Raleigh.

From her outline...\n\n<i>Social media tools are becoming ever more popular, powerful and prevalent, and no one loves them more than our students. Those of us in IT have the opportunity to use these tools to communicate with students and help to improve the campus community. But when is social media too much social and not enough useful? What are the goals of using social media in the campus business model and how do we make sure we\u2019re achieving those goals?\n\nJoin us while we consider what constitutes a \u201csocial medium\u201d and consider the channels IT organizations should be using. We\u2019ll be taking a look at all the trendy tools of technology: Twitter, Facebook, blogs and wikis, location-based applications and more. We\u2019ll chat about the day-to-day use of these tools: how to unleash the power of hash tags, provide consistent value in 140 characters, and aggregate all of your \u201cofficial\u201d university feeds on Twitter. We\u2019ll also be discussing the importance of personal vs. professional identities, the implications of Facebook\u2019s privacy settings and how to educate students (and faculty and staff!) on using discretion.</i>","createdDate":"2010-11-30T19:50:53.000Z","updatedDate":"2010-12-02T15:30:49.000Z","approved":"Y","startDate":"2010-12-02T14:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2010-12-02T15:00:00.000Z","showGuestList":"1","location":"Cox Hall - NC State Main Campus - Room 206","organizedBy":"17x8avmzkahg9","attendees":[{"contributorName":"10qko885d67so","attendeeStatus":"attending"},{"contributorName":"1ttn1970su7k6","attendeeStatus":"maybe"},{"contributorName":"1ofqn8jwi6fza","attendeeStatus":"declined"},{"contributorName":"2rf1k1zw8yycr","attendeeStatus":"declined"},{"contributorName":"3ggtou3xgbk6l","attendeeStatus":"maybe"},{"contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","attendeeStatus":"attending"}]},{"id":"2486881:Event:12656","contributorName":"27wih35ubsbiw","title":"Alone Together: New Intimacies and Solitudes of the Digital Age","description":"In her address, \"Alone Together: New Intimacies and Solitudes of the Digital Age,\" <a href=\"http://www.mit.edu/~sturkle/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Sherry Turkle</a> will discuss how technology is seductive when its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance#Affordances_as_action_possibilities\" target=\"_blank\">affordances</a> meet our human vulnerabilities.

Atom on the other hand uses a format (RFC 3339) which complies with ISO8601 and is nearly identical to MySQL datetime format.\n\nIn case anyone is still reading and is looking for the soap opera that is RSS versioning, check out <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28file_format%29\" target=\"_blank\">the Wikipedia article on the RSS file format</a>.","createdDate":"2010-08-06T12:55:13.000Z"},{"id":"2486881:Comment:12306","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","description":"Thanks for coming out today.

If you know me, you know that I strive to produce events that help users move up from their current level by building an opportunity for them to learn from the right presentation collection and through at-event peer networking.\n\nRegarding The RealWorld DITA 2009 Conference in Raleigh, North Carolina USA, WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT UPDATE: The conference has been listed as 3 days of DITA presentations. Regular rate was $695. Edu rates are $250 for staff and $100 for students. Above And Beyond Learning knows that the economy makes conference attendance difficult. We realize that despite the reasonableness of the conference registration rate, some companies and individuals just basically cannot spend $695 plus three nights of travel. So, we are doing the following:\n\n* Dropping the conference rate to $450 for both days; Edu rates stay\nthe same as above. Dates are now September 14-15, 2009 as the third day (Sept 16) has been mashed into the other two longger days.\n\n* Allowing registrants to sign up or either or both days at half their\nappropriate rate.\n\n* Providing discounts for multiple attendees (2-3 registered/paid\ntogether are $100 discount per person; 4+ r/p together are $200 discount per person)\n\n* Allowing hardship discount on a per-case basis; available for\nbusinesses or individuals\n\nSchedule and more information online:\n<a href=\"http://www.aboveandbeyondlearning.com/ditaconference.html\">http://www.aboveandbeyondlearning.com/ditaconference.html</a>\n\nThank you to our speakers for presenting.

We figured that would be easy for everyone and anybody can park over there.\n\nIf you have them, they recommend bringing some basic tools like work gloves, hammer, tape measure, toolbelt and pencil. If you don't have any of these, no worries, they will provide them. Just make sure you label whatever you bring.\n\nYou will need to provide your own bagged lunch. We will break for lunch around noon. I will be bringing a cooler and some ice, so bring some water or gatorade and we can keep it cool.\n\nAs far as what to wear, make sure you have good work shoes (boots are best, sneakers are ok). No sandals or open-toed shoes. You will probably get dirty, so plan accordingly. They also recommend avoiding baggy clothes, and to wear a good hat. Also you should sunscreen it up.\n\nFrom what I have been told, we are going to be working on shingling, back-framing, and siding. If it rains, that doesn't necessarily mean we won't be working, so show up anyway. I have a hotline number to call to see if we are still working if it rains.\n\nI need a headcount by next wednesday (6/10), so please RSVP ASAP!\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know.\n\nBTW, Here is what habitat sent me: <a href=\"http://www.habitatwake.org/d/FAQ_ConstructionVol_Ral_AugustaCrossings_Spr09.pdf\">http://www.habitatwake.org/d/FAQ_ConstructionVol_Ral_AugustaCrossings_Spr09.pdf</a>","createdDate":"2009-06-01T14:16:16.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-06-15T13:41:14.000Z","approved":"Y","startDate":"2009-06-12T07:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2009-06-12T17:00:00.000Z","showGuestList":"1","location":"Evans Road, Raleigh, 27610 lot 1 and 51","organizedBy":"17x8avmzkahg9","attendees":[{"contributorName":"1sm5vbaau1lox","attendeeStatus":"attending"},{"contributorName":"2zcnsukt2voqj","attendeeStatus":"attending"},{"contributorName":"22d8ohcn3r426","attendeeStatus":"attending"},{"contributorName":"1eracb58xe19h","attendeeStatus":"invited"},{"contributorName":"211tgo999ov7e","attendeeStatus":"invited"},{"contributorName":"38dwd1leu61vn","attendeeStatus":"invited"},{"contributorName":"1ofqn8jwi6fza","attendeeStatus":"invited"},{"contributorName":"1m89sv3p0ar0c","attendeeStatus":"invited"},{"contributorName":"2k7vvpf9lb3q6","attendeeStatus":"invited"},{"contributorName":"25f2wpbzy4qg8","attendeeStatus":"attending"},{"contributorName":"048o8i00t8d9v","attendeeStatus":"declined"},{"contributorName":"3p7bzgj31hmap","attendeeStatus":"attending"},{"contributorName":"27wih35ubsbiw","attendeeStatus":"attending"},{"contributorName":"11j9b5inrnbhl","attendeeStatus":"attending"},{"contributorName":"3h8vedhr1e7gr","attendeeStatus":"attending"},{"contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","attendeeStatus":"attending"},{"contributorName":"2nzrrfshzfg2m","attendeeStatus":"attending"},{"contributorName":"2clztbsxotepb","attendeeStatus":"attending"},{"contributorName":"36mexpty3zftm","attendeeStatus":"attending"},{"contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","attendeeStatus":"attending"}],"comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:7101","contributorName":"11j9b5inrnbhl","description":"Thanks for putting this together Jason Awesome!

The web is becoming both the infrastructure and the platform for these services. Accessibility and usability of this space can no longer be prescriptive, but requires an understanding of how people with disability use the web and integrating their needs in the design and development of the environment.\n\nMargaret Hudacko, Mike Vysocka, Hal Meeks, Troy Hurteau and Greg Kraus have all volunteered to share their experiences to start the conversation.

Let me know if you decide to register. The rate is good whether we hit the desired 10 or not. I told the conference chair that the spending freeze made it impossible for many to pay now, if ever.\n\nHi Ellen:\n\nWe can do $250 for NCSU staff/faculty and $100 for current students.\n\nNote that we are doing payment plans this year. With the XML conference 3 months away, each payment would be broken into 4 pieces if they register right now, 3 pieces if they register next month, etc. They would have to be paid in full prior to entering the conference.\n\nThe first payment would be payable upon registration (now), and then the other payments due May 1, June 1, and July 1. For the $250, each payment if broken into 4 would be $62.50 per payment. For students, it would be $25.00 per payment.\n\nNOW, to do this, we would really like to get a MINIMUM of 10 NCSU people registered to justify the low rate. Do you think we can get that many confirmed and maybe even get some of them to register and pay their $62.50 or $25.00 payment now?\n\nThank you again for your great support. I hope that these conferences\ncontinue to be of value to you, your colleagues, and students.\n\nTake care,\n\nKay Whatley","createdDate":"2009-04-17T19:25:08.000Z"}]},{"id":"2486881:Event:600","contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","title":"DrupalCon DC 2009","description":"DrupalCon DC - http://dc2009.drupalcon.org\n\n\"<i>It's where decisions are made, clients and talent are found, and new stuff is unveiled.</i>\"","createdDate":"2008-11-14T14:28:17.000Z","updatedDate":"2009-02-26T13:45:08.000Z","startDate":"2009-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2009-03-07T17:00:00.000Z","showGuestList":"1","location":"Washington DC","website":"http://dc2009.drupalcon.org","organizedBy":"Drupal ... but added to this site by Nick Young","photoUrl":"events/28-DrupalCon.png","attendees":[{"contributorName":"3h8vedhr1e7gr","attendeeStatus":"declined"},{"contributorName":"19wgwss45yepg","attendeeStatus":"declined"},{"contributorName":"3p7bzgj31hmap","attendeeStatus":"declined"},{"contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","attendeeStatus":"declined"}]},{"id":"2486881:Event:185","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","title":"UNC Cause 2008","description":"The University of North Carolina Tomorrow: Striving for Excellence Through Technology and Collaboration.","createdDate":"2008-11-11T13:15:04.000Z","updatedDate":"2008-11-11T19:40:37.000Z","startDate":"2008-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2008-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","showGuestList":"1","location":"UNC Greensboro","city":"Greensboro, NC","website":"http://www.uncg.edu/cause08/","organizedBy":"17x8avmzkahg9","photoUrl":"events/29-logo.jpg","attendees":[{"contributorName":"19wgwss45yepg","attendeeStatus":"declined"},{"contributorName":"3h8vedhr1e7gr","attendeeStatus":"attending"},{"contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","attendeeStatus":"attending"},{"contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9","attendeeStatus":"attending"}],"comments":[{"id":"2486881:Comment:246","contributorName":"3hocxvb8cf1sa","description":"I will be going too.
