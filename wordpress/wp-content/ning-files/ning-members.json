We have drank the Zend Koolaid and do a LOT of work with Zend Framework and Zend Studio. We also heavily use jQuery and mootools as our primary javascript libraries. We use Smarty for templating right now. Lately we have been in the land of Drupal...but apparently everyone on campus is in that land now :)\n\nWe are big fans of version control, so we keep all our projects in subversion. You can check out or projects that we have going at http://webapps.ncsu.edu/lifecycle/.\n\nOur applications focus mostly on internal support tools, but all of our work is open sourced. Another primary function of our job is helping people determine their workflows, then building applications that enhance that process. We also teach some classes (which a lot of you guys have been to) on Zend Framework, PHP5 and design patterns. We don't get to do it as much as we would like because we have a lot going on."},"profilePhoto":"http://api.ning.com/files/lDuS9x52INcolVqyUitFo-aw3VTF0juMdviNZ4w*xG4zTt-WS-v8yVzOBoV0552UjfSRVT6oWkcO-3Fbupn9ByAdPAUugqSb/engagementpics033.jpg?crop=1%3A1","level":"owner","state":"active","contributorName":"17x8avmzkahg9"}])
